,a175E000001tuzJQAQ,EUR,true,,"<br>CONDITIONS GENERALES DE VENTE<br>- IMCD France SAS -<br> <br>1.             Article préliminaire<br> <br>Les Conditions Générales de Vente (ci-après dénommées « CGV ») ci-après définies s’appliquent de plein droit à toutes les commandes de Produits (ci-après dénommés « Produit(s) »), passées par tout acheteur (ci-après dénommé l’« Acheteur ») auprès de la société IMCD France SAS (ci-après dénommée « IMCD ») dans le cadre des marchés qu’elle traite, et à toutes les ventes réalisées par IMCD et ce, nonobstant toute clause ou condition contraire émanant de l’Acheteur. En conséquence, toute commande passée à IMCD, quelle qu’en soit l’origine, implique nécessairement, à titre de condition essentielle et déterminante, l’adhésion entière et sans réserve par l’Acheteur aux présentes CGV, qui constituent le socle unique de la négociation commerciale, conformément aux dispositions de l’article L.441-6 du Code de commerce. Toutes conditions contraires, et notamment toutes conditions générales ou particulières émanant de l’Acheteur, y compris celles figurant dans ses éventuelles conditions d’achat et sur ses bons de commande sont en conséquence inopposables à IMCD, sauf acceptation préalable et écrite de IMCD. La négociation commerciale entre l’Acheteur et IMCD devra être menée dans le respect mutuel des intérêts des parties avec loyauté et bonne foi et dans le respect des exigences de l’article L. 442-6, I, 2° du Code de commerce. Celui-ci sanctionnant la soumission ou la tentative de soumission à des obligations créant un déséquilibre significatif dans les droits et obligations des parties, IMCD ne pourra en aucun cas, consentir des avantages commerciaux ou conditions particulières de vente qui ne feraient pas l’objet d’une contrepartie équivalente et équilibrée de la part de l’Acheteur.<br> Le fait de ne pas se prévaloir, à un moment donné, de l’une quelconque des présentes CGV, ne peut être interprété par l’Acheteur comme valant renonciation par IMCD à se prévaloir ultérieurement de l’une quelconque desdites conditions. Les présentes CGV sont modifiables à tout moment, étant entendu que toute éventuelle modification sera notifiée à l’Acheteur et qu’elle prendra effet à la date de réception de la notification.<br>                                                                                                <br>2.             Commandes<br> <br>Toute Commande doit être adressée directement à IMCD par courrier, courrier électronique, EDI ou télécopie.<br> <br>Toute commande ne sera acceptée définitivement par IMCD que lorsqu’IMCD en aura accusé réception auprès de l’Acheteur par courrier électronique ou télécopie. Toute annulation ou modification de commande de l’Acheteur devra être notifiée par écrit à IMCD et devra faire l’objet d’une acceptation préalable expresse et écrite d’IMCD, que cette dernière se réserve le droit de refuser. Aucune annulation ou modification de la commande de l’Acheteur ne sera opposable à IMCD passé un délai de 48 heures après expédition de la confirmation de la commande. En cas de problème de solvabilité de l’Acheteur, IMCD se réserve le droit d’exiger de l’Acheteur le paiement du montant de la commande avant expédition des Produits. IMCD se réserve le droit de refuser les commandes en cas de manquement de l’Acheteur à l’une quelconque de ses obligations et, plus généralement, de refuser ou de réduire, sans versement des pénalités éventuellement prévues dans les conditions générales d’achat de l’Acheteur, toute commande présentant un caractère anormal sur le plan des quantités, des délais ou des fréquences de livraison, ou passée de mauvaise foi. IMCD se réserve le droit d’exiger préalablement de l’Acheteur le paiement du montant total de la commande. A cette fin, IMCD adressera à l’Acheteur une facture pro forma. La commande ne sera alors considérée comme ferme et définitive qu’à l’encaissement par IMCD du montant facturé. IMCD se réserve le droit, même en cours d’exécution de commande, d’exiger une garantie, qui pourra notamment prendre la forme d’une caution bancaire pour la bonne exécution des engagements, tout refus autorisant l’annulation de tout ou partie des commandes passées.<br> <br>3.             Tarifs<br> <br>Les tarifs communiqués à l’Acheteur s’entendent hors taxes DAP. Toutefois, un tarif EXW peut être envisagé après accord de nos services. Les tarifs des Produits sont fixés par nos conditions tarifaires en vigueur au jour de la commande, sauf avis contraire. Les tarifs sont susceptibles d’être révisés avec un préavis de trente jours, et ceci avant la fin de validité d’une offre en cours.<br> <br> <br>Tout Acheteur qui passe commande après la communication du nouveau tarif pour livraison de celle-ci après l’entrée en vigueur des nouveaux tarifs est réputé avoir accepté ces derniers qui prévaudront sur toute information éventuellement divergente qui pourrait figurer dans la commande. Ces dispositions sont considérées comme déterminantes de l’accord entre IMCD et l’Acheteur, et chaque vente intervenant postérieurement à la communication du nouveau tarif sera pleinement soumise à celui-ci. Tout refus de paiement des factures établies sur la base des tarifs, en ce compris tout nouveau tarif, sera assimilé à un défaut de paiement autorisant dès lors IMCD à refuser toute nouvelle commande de produits et à suspendre immédiatement les livraisons en cours après en avoir informé l’Acheteur.<br> <br>4.             Livraisons<br> <br>La livraison s’effectue au lieu de destination convenu entre l’Acheteur et IMCD et les risques afférents aux Produits sont transférés à l’Acheteur au moment de ladite livraison. Les délais de livraison sont donnés à titre purement indicatif et sans garantie. En conséquence, les retards de livraison ne peuvent donner lieu ni à des pénalités, ni à des dommages intérêts, ni à des annulations de commandes, ni à des refus de livraison ou encore à des rétentions de paiements des factures, sauf accord préalable et écrit d’IMCD, et ce, nonobstant l’existence de clauses contraires dans les éventuelles conditions d’achat de l’Acheteur. Seul le préjudice réellement supporté par l’Acheteur, démontré et évalué, pourra faire l’objet d’une demande de réparation qui ne pourra en tout état de cause intervenir qu’après négociation avec IMCD et accord des deux parties. A défaut d’accord, l’évaluation du préjudice subi interviendra à dire d’expert nommé par le Président du Tribunal de Commerce de Bobigny, à la requête de la partie la plus diligente. Les délais de livraison éventuellement acceptés par IMCD sont de plein droit suspendus par tout événement indépendant du contrôle d’IMCD et ayant pour conséquence de retarder la livraison, et notamment en cas de force majeure telle que définie sous l’article 6 ci-après. Toute contestation ou réclamation sur la conformité des Produits livrés devra être formulée par l’Acheteur par écrit auprès d’IMCD dans un délai de 15 jours suivant la livraison. Passé ce délai, aucune contestation ou réclamation ne sera recevable. Les modes d’approvisionnement de nos produits convenus entre l’Acheteur et IMCD ne pourront évoluer au cours de l’année, sauf accord préalable et écrit d’IMCD.<br>Dans le cadre d’une commande avec enlèvement par l’Acheteur, ce dernier a un délai de 7 jours après la date de confirmation de mise à disposition des produits pour procéder à l’enlèvement. Passé ce délai, IMCD sera en droit de facturer le prix convenu et/ou des coûts de stockage.<br> <br>5.             Transport<br> <br>Lors de l’acheminement des Produits par un transporteur, il appartient à l’Acheteur de vérifier les Produits à leur réception en présence du transporteur et de former, dans les formes et délais légaux, toutes réserves caractérisées et justifiées ainsi que toutes réclamations au transporteur dans un délai de soixante-douze (72) heures à compter de la prise de livraison des Produits, conformément aux dispositions des articles L.133-3 et suivants du Code de commerce. L’Acheteur doit également en informer IMCD par lettre recommandée avec accusé de réception dans les mêmes délais, accompagnée d’une photocopie de la lettre adressée au transporteur. En tout état de cause, l’Acheteur fera son affaire personnelle de tous les recours éventuels contre le transporteur en cas, notamment, de manquants, d’avaries, de retards, non spécifiés lors de la livraison des Produits. En cas d’absence de prise de livraison par l’Acheteur, non dûment justifiée, ou de retard dans la prise en charge des Produits, l’Acheteur en supportera tous les risques. IMCD sera en droit de mettre les Produits en entrepôt aux frais de l’Acheteur et de lui réclamer le remboursement des frais de transport, étant précisé que IMCD sera en droit de résilier le contrat et de procéder à la revente des Produits et ce, sans préjudice du versement à IMCD de dommages et intérêts pour le préjudice qu’elle pourrait subir. Pour les produits vendus EXW, la reconnaissance et la vérification des Produits doivent être faites au départ par l’Acheteur ou son transporteur.<br> <br>6.             Retour<br> <br>Aucun retour de Produits livrés ne sera admis sans l’accord préalable et écrit d’IMCD. A défaut de cet accord écrit, les Produits retournés seront tenus à la disposition de l’Acheteur avec facturation des frais de magasinage. En toute hypothèse, les coûts afférents au transport des Produits retournés resteront à la charge de l’Acheteur.<br> <br>7.             Force majeure<br> <br>IMCD n’encourt aucune responsabilité en cas de non exécution ou de retard dans l’exécution de l’une quelconque de ses obligations au titre du contrat de vente si cette non exécution ou ce retard résultent d’un cas fortuit ou de force majeure subi par IMCD, l’un de ses fournisseurs ou l’un de ses sous-traitants. En cas de force majeure ou de cas fortuit subi par IMCD, l’un de ses fournisseurs ou l’un de ses sous-traitants, IMCD pourra résilier totalement ou partiellement le contrat de vente conclu avec l’Acheteur ou, si l’empêchement est momentané, IMCD pourra suspendre l’exécution de ses obligations sans préavis ni indemnité jusqu’à ce que le cas fortuit ou la force majeure viennent à cesser. Si dans un délai d’un mois suivant la notification d’une suspension à l’Acheteur, IMCD ne peut indiquer une nouvelle date de livraison à l’Acheteur, celui-ci aura la faculté de résilier le marché ou la commande mais uniquement pour la quantité de marchandises ou de Produits qui ne pourra lui être expédiée ou livrée en raison du cas fortuit ou de force majeure. Aucune indemnité, de quelque nature qu’elle soit, ne pourra être réclamée par l’Acheteur à IMCD.<br> <br>De façon non limitative, sont considérés comme cas de force majeure ou cas fortuits:<br>-       guerre (déclarée ou non déclarée), guerre civile, émeute et révolution, acte de piraterie, terrorisme<br>-       sabotage, réquisition, confiscation, nationalisation, embargo et expropriation,<br>-       cataclysme naturel tel que violente tempête, cyclone, tremblement de terre, raz de marée, inondation, destruction par la foudre,<br>-       explosion, incendie, destruction de machines, d’usines et d’installations quelles qu’elles soient,<br>-       rationnement de combustible, carburants,<br>-       boycott, grève et lock-out sous quelque forme que ce soit, grève du zèle, affectant notamment les moyens de transport, occupation d’usines et de locaux, arrêt de travail,<br>-       impossibilité pour IMCD d’être approvisionnée en matières premières,<br>-       acte de l’autorité, qu’il soit licite ou illicite, arbitraire ou non.<br>-       évolution de la législation rendant impossible la fourniture d’un produit<br> <br>8.             Facturation – Paiement<br> <br>Nos factures sont payables à 30 jours nets à compter de la date d’émission de la facture, sauf stipulation contraire.<br>Les factures sont émises par IMCD à la date de livraison et sont conformes aux règles de facturation visées sous l’article L.441-3 du Code de commerce. Elles sont établies en euros et sont payables au siège social d’IMCD, sauf accord contraire.<br>Aucun escompte ne sera accordé en cas de paiement anticipé. Conformément aux dispositions de l&#39;article L.441-6 alinéa 12 du Code de commerce, toute inexécution par l’Acheteur, partielle ou totale, de ses obligations de paiement ou tout retard de règlement par rapport à la date d&#39;échéance indiquée sur la facture, entraînera : 1) l’exigibilité de plein droit d’une pénalité d’un montant calculé à hauteur de 3 fois le taux d’intérêt légal en vigueur à la date d’échéance. 2) le versement d’une indemnité forfaitaire pour frais de recouvrement d’un montant de 40 euros. Il est précisé que cette indemnité forfaitaire n’est pas limitative du montant des autres frais qui pourraient être engagés par notre société aux fins de recouvrement de ces factures. Les intérêts commenceront à courir à compter de la date de paiement figurant sur la facture et continueront à courir jusqu’au jour du parfait paiement de la totalité des sommes dues. Tout mois commencé sera intégralement dû. Si, par ailleurs, IMCD est mise dans l&#39;obligation de s&#39;adresser à un mandataire (Avocat, Huissier, etc.) pour obtenir le règlement des sommes dues, il est expressément convenu, à titre de clause pénale stipulée forfaitairement, de plein droit, et non réductible, l&#39;application d&#39;une majoration calculée au taux de 10 % des sommes dues par l’Acheteur et ce, sans préjudice des frais de recouvrement exposés, des intérêts de retard et dommages et intérêts éventuels.<br>De manière générale, toute compensation est interdite, et si elle est opérée en l’absence d’un accord préalable et écrit d’IMCD, elle sera assimilable à un défaut de paiement, autorisant dès lors IMCD à refuser toute nouvelle commande de Produits et à suspendre immédiatement les livraisons en cours après en avoir informé l’Acheteur. En cas de défaut de paiement d’une facture à son terme ou en cas de défaut de paiement d’une échéance dans l’hypothèse d’un paiement échelonné, la totalité des factures et des échéances restant dues par l’Acheteur deviendra immédiatement exigible, même si elles ont donné lieu à des traites. En cas d’insolvabilité notoire, de paiement au delà de la date d’échéance, en cas d’ouverture d’une procédure de sauvegarde de justice, de redressement ou de liquidation judiciaire, IMCD pourra, sous réserve des dispositions impératives de l’article L. 622-13 du Code de commerce :<br>- procéder de plein droit et sans autre formalité, à la reprise des Produits correspondant à la commande en cause et éventuellement aux commandes impayées antérieures que leur paiement soit échu ou non ;<br>- résilier de plein droit la / les commande(s) en cours en totalité sur simple avis donné à l’Acheteur par lettre recommandée avec demande d’avis de réception, sans autre formalité et sans préjudice de l’exercice de tous ses autres droits. Toute détérioration du crédit de l’Acheteur pourra, à tout moment, justifier, en fonction des risques encourus, la fixation d&#39;un plafond au découvert de celui-ci, l&#39;exigence de certains délais de paiement, d&#39;un règlement comptant ou de certaines garanties. Ce sera notamment le cas si une cession, location gérance, mise en nantissement ou un apport de son fonds de commerce, ou encore un changement de contrôle ou de structure de sa société (fusion, etc.…) est susceptible de produire un effet défavorable sur le crédit de l’Acheteur. Conformément aux dispositions visées sous l’article L.622-7 du Code de commerce et par convention expresse, en cas d’ouverture d’une procédure de sauvegarde, de mise en redressement ou liquidation judiciaire d&#39;un Acheteur, le montant non encore payé des factures qu&#39;il aurait pu émettre au titre des prestations effectuées au profit d’IMCD et celui des réductions de prix éventuellement dues se compensera de plein droit avec les sommes qu&#39;il resterait devoir à IMCD, celles-ci devenant immédiatement exigibles.<br> <br> <br>9.             Clause de réserve de propriété<br> <br>Il est expressément convenu qu’IMCD se réserve la propriété des Produits livrés jusqu’au paiement intégral du prix en principal, intérêts, taxes et tous frais accessoires. A cet égard, ne constitue pas un paiement au sens de la présente clause, la remise d’une traite, d’un chèque bancaire ou de tout titre créant une obligation de payer. Le paiement ne pourra être considéré effectué que lors de l’encaissement effectif du prix par IMCD. Si les Produits, objet de la réserve de propriété, ont été revendus par l’Acheteur, après transformation ou non, la créance d’IMCD sera automatiquement transportée sur la créance du prix des Produits ainsi vendus par l’Acheteur. L’Acheteur cède, dès à présent, à IMCD toutes les créances qui naîtraient de la revente des Produits impayés sous réserve de propriété. En cas de sauvegarde de justice ou de redressement ou de liquidation judiciaire de l’Acheteur, les Produits pourront être revendiqués, conformément aux dispositions légales et/ou réglementaires en vigueur. En cas de revendication des Produits, pour non paiement partiel ou total, les marchandises en stock seront réputées correspondre aux créances impayées. Conformément à l’article L.624-16 du Code du commerce, nonobstant toutes clauses contraires, la présente clause de réserve de propriété est opposable aux tiers. IMCD est d’ores et déjà autorisée par l’Acheteur qui accepte, à faire dresser un inventaire et/ou mettre sous séquestre les Produits impayés détenus par lui. Tous acomptes antérieurement payés resteront acquis à IMCD à titre de clause pénale. L’Acheteur sera tenu pour seul responsable de tous les risques de détérioration, de perte, de destruction partielle ou totale, quelle que soit la cause du dommage, même s’il s’agit d’un cas fortuit ou de force majeure. L’Acheteur devra en conséquence assurer lesdits Produits, sous réserve de propriété, stipuler dans la police d’assurance que toute indemnité sera payée directement à IMCD et fournir à cette dernière, à sa première demande, toute justification de l&#39;assurance ainsi souscrite. Jusqu’au complet paiement, l’Acheteur s’interdit de conférer un nantissement ou gage sur les Produits vendus, sous réserve de propriété, ou de les utiliser à titre de garantie. L’Acheteur s’oblige à informer tout tiers, notamment en cas de saisie, du fait que les Produits sous clause de réserve de propriété appartiennent à IMCD et à informer IMCD immédiatement de toute saisie ou opération similaire. Nonobstant la présente clause de réserve de propriété, tous les risques afférents aux Produits vendus sont à la charge de l’Acheteur, dès remise des Produits au transporteur ou à l’Acheteur directement.<br> <br>10.          Suspension des livraisons<br> <br>Le défaut de paiement du prix de vente par l’Acheteur pour quelque cause que ce soit autorisera IMCD à cesser de plein droit toute livraison et à procéder à l’annulation de toute commande en cours.<br> <br>11.          Produits – Sécurité<br> <br>L’utilisation par l’Acheteur des Produits vendus peut s’avérer dangereuse et c’est la raison pour laquelle l’Acheteur s’engage à prendre connaissance du contenu des fiches de données de sécurité et/ou des fiches techniques des Produits vendus. L’Acheteur est tenu de prendre toutes les mesures de sécurité nécessaires avant toute utilisation ou manipulation, sous quelque forme que ce soit, des Produits vendus.<br>Il est recommandé à l’Acheteur de consulter IMCD en cas de doute sur l’utilisation ou la manipulation des Produits vendus, étant précisé que les conseils et informations fournis par IMCD ne pourront en aucun cas engager la responsabilité d’IMCD.<br>De manière générale, l’Acheteur s’engage à se conformer en toutes circonstances à toute disposition légale applicable dans le cadre de son activité et notamment celles relatives à la sécurité des personnes et des biens, la santé publique et la protection de l’environnement.<br> <br>12.          Propriété intellectuelle<br> <br>L’Acheteur reconnaît expressément qu’il n’acquiert, au terme des présentes, aucun droit sur l’un quelconque des éléments de propriété intellectuelle et notamment les secrets de fabrication, les brevets qu’IMCD utilise soit pour en être le titulaire, soit parce qu’elle y est autorisée par le titulaire desdits droits. L’Acheteur ne pourra faire état ou usage des droits de propriété intellectuelle appartenant à IMCD ou que celle-ci est autorisée à utiliser, qu&#39;avec l&#39;autorisation expresse, écrite et préalable du titulaire de ces droits et dans le seul cadre des présentes. IMCD se réserve le droit de s&#39;opposer, de faire cesser ou de demander réparation de toute utilisation qu&#39;elle jugerait déloyale, constitutive d’un acte de parasitisme commercial, contraire à son image ou à une autorisation qu’elle aurait donnée. Dans l’hypothèse où l’Acheteur ferait usage, sans y avoir été autorisé, des droits de propriété intellectuelle appartenant à IMCD ou que celle-ci est autorisée à utiliser, et que cet usage conduirait un tiers à exercer une action à l’encontre d’IMCD, l’Acheteur garantira IMCD contre ce recours. Par ailleurs, l’Acheteur qui aurait connaissance d’une contrefaçon d’un droit de propriété intellectuelle appartenant à IMCD ou que celle-ci est autorisée à utiliser, devra l’en informer immédiatement par e‑mail, confirmé par lettre recommandée avec demande d’avis de réception.  En outre, l’Acheteur informera IMCD, dès qu’il en aura connaissance, de toute action judiciaire intentée contre lui en matière de propriété intellectuelle concernant les produits et ne prendra aucune mesure sans en avoir référé préalablement à IMCD qui avisera de la suite à y donner, le cas échéant en accord avec le titulaire des droits.<br> <br>13.          Garantie – Responsabilité<br> <br>A l’égard d’un Acheteur de même spécialité qu’IMCD, cette dernière exclut toute garantie légale des vices cachés telle que définie par les articles 1641 et suivants du Code civil.<br>A l’égard d’un Acheteur qui ne serait pas de la même spécialité qu’IMCD, l’Acheteur devra fournir à IMCD toute justification quant à la réalité du vice allégué. L’Acheteur devra laisser à IMCD toute facilité pour procéder à la constatation du vice allégué. L’Acheteur s’abstiendra d’intervenir lui-même ou de faire intervenir un tiers à cette fin. Toute intervention d’un tiers ou de l’Acheteur sur le produit sera de nature à exonérer IMCD en termes de garantie et de responsabilité.<br> <br>L’Acheteur est seul responsable du choix et des conditions d’emploi des Produits qu’il a commandés auprès d’IMCD. Il appartient à l’Acheteur de s’assurer avant de passer commande que les produits d’IMCD conviennent à l’utilisation envisagée par lui. IMCD ne garantit aucune performance particulière d’un Produit,  ni aucune utilisation particulière d’un Produit qui n’aurait été préalablement portée à sa connaissance par écrit et acceptée expressément par IMCD. IMCD ne pourra, notamment, en aucun cas être responsable des dommages de toutes sortes causés par l’utilisation, le mélange, la manipulation ou l’incorporation à une formulation, par le stockage ou le transport des Produits vendus, et IMCD ne pourra en aucun cas être tenu de réparer lesdits dommages.<br> <br>Quelque soit le fondement de son obligation à réparation, y compris consécutivement à un vice caché, IMCD ne sera tenue à la réparation d’aucun dommage immatériel, direct ou indirect, coûts et pertes de quelque sorte que ce soit consécutifs à l’achat ou à l’utilisation des Produits. L’Acheteur devra prendre toute assurance nécessaire, avec renonciation à recours, pour de tels dommages, coûts et pertes. Les frais de transport des Produits retournés avec l’accord préalable et écrit d’IMCD seront à la charge de cette dernière. S’agissant de tout dommage matériel, l’obligation à réparation d’IMCD est limitée, au choix d’IMCD, soit au remplacement des Produits, soit à l’établissement d’un avoir, sans donner droit au versement d’une quelconque autre indemnité pour quelque cause que ce soit.<br> <br>En application de l’article 2254 du Code civil, toute action se rapportant à la conformité d’un produit vendu par IMCD se prescrit par un an à compter de la livraison du Produit.<br> <br>14.          Exclusion de toutes pénalités<br> <br>Nonobstant toutes clauses ou dispositions contraires pouvant figurer dans des conditions d’achat de l’Acheteur, aucune pénalité, de quelque nature que ce soit, ne sera acceptée par IMCD sauf accord préalable et écrit de IMCD et ce, quelle que soit la motivation de la pénalité. IMCD n’accepte pas de débits d’office. Seul le préjudice éventuellement subi et préalablement démontré par l’Acheteur pourra, après accord préalable et écrit d’IMCD, ouvrir droit à réparation. L’Acheteur devra, à cet égard, fournir à IMCD tout document attestant du préjudice réellement subi (bon de livraison, etc). En cas de violation de la présente clause par l’Acheteur, IMCD pourra suspendre ses livraisons.<br> <br>15.          Confidentialité<br> <br>IMCD et l’Acheteur reconnaissent qu’ils pourront, dans le cadre de l’exécution de leurs relations commerciales, se voir confier des informations confidentielles de nature technique, commerciale, marketing, financière ou relatives à des éléments auxquels des droits de propriété intellectuelle sont attachés. Cette liste n’est toutefois pas limitative. Ces informations ne devront pas, d’une quelconque façon, être divulguées à des tiers. Les Parties garantissent la confidentialité des informations, de quelque nature qu&#39;elles soient, écrites ou orales, dont ils auront connaissance dans le cadre de l’exécution de leurs relations commerciales et s&#39;interdisent de les communiquer aux personnes autres que celles qui ont qualité pour les connaître au titre de celles-ci, sous peine de devoir en réparer le préjudice subi.<br> <br>16.          Contestations commerciales – Prescription<br> <br>Toute contestation de la part de l’Acheteur relative à l&#39;ensemble de la relation commerciale existant avec IMCD devra être formulée au plus tard dans les douze (12) mois suivant l’expiration de l’année civile au cours de laquelle la contestation est née. A défaut, et par dérogation expresse aux dispositions visées sous l’article L.110-4 du Code de Commerce, aucune réclamation ou contestation ne pourra plus être présentée et sera considérée, dès lors, comme étant strictement irrecevable et l’action de l’Acheteur prescrite.<br> <br>17.          Droit applicable- Attribution de juridiction<br> <br>L’ensemble de la relation contractuelle entre IMCD et l’Acheteur issue de l’application des présentes CGV, et les éventuels accords particuliers qui pourraient être conclus, et tous les litiges en découlant, quelle qu’en soit la nature, seront soumis à tous égards au droit français. Les dispositions issues de la convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandise, signée à Vienne le 11 avril 1980, sont inapplicables aux relations entretenues par IMCD avec l’Acheteur. L’illégalité ou l’invalidé éventuelles d’une clause de cet accord n’affectera pas la légitimité ou validité des autres clauses. IMCD et l’Acheteur conviennent de faire leur possible pour résoudre à l’amiable les désaccords susceptibles de résulter de l’interprétation, l’exécution ou la cessation de leur relation commerciale. Tout litige ayant son origine dans l’exécution des relations contractuelles établies entre IMCD et l’Acheteur, ainsi que les actes qui en seront la conséquence, sera soumis à la compétence exclusive des Tribunaux compétents de Bobigny, nonobstant toute demande incidente ou tout appel en garantie, ou en cas de pluralité de défendeurs, sauf application des dispositions issues du décret du 11 novembre 2009 sur la spécialisation des juridictions en matière de pratiques restrictives de concurrence. Cette clause d’attribution de compétence s’appliquera même en cas de référé.",All,false,1,Approved,FR SL,,a0t5E000002gGvQQAU

In the event of a conflict between these General Conditions of Sale and the Incoterms, the latter will prevail. </p><p>3.3.   Samples or individual analyses as well as the analysis sheets which are given to the buyer have only an indicative value.</p><p>3.4.   The delivery period given applies only as an indication.</p><p>3.5.   In the event of any delay in the delivery, the buyer shall under no circumstances be entitled to compensation, nor be entitled to cancel the agreement.</p><p>3.6.   In case of force majeure, such as serious frost, strikes, business interruptions due to technical malfunctions which impede the normal work in our installations or in those of our suppliers, late or defective delivery by IMCD’s suppliers and other events beyond the control of IMCD Benelux N.V., IMCD Benelux N.V. shall have the right to suspend or to terminate the agreement without being obliged to pay any compensation. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 4 - Risk transfer.</p><p>4.1.   The risk attached to the goods purchased will pass to the buyer at the time of delivery. The time of delivery is the time that the goods purchased arrive at the place of delivery, even if the buyer does not accept the delivery. For delivery ex-works, the time of delivery is the time that IMCD Benelux N.V. notifies the buyer that the goods purchased are ready for collection.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 5 - Reservation of title.</p><p>5.1.   All goods delivered by us remain, even if they are processed, our property until full payment of all our debt claims, including interests and costs, as well as any balance in our favour deriving from earlier transactions. The goods can therefore be recovered at any time by IMCD Benelux N.V. during the entire title reservation period.</p><p>5.2.   Before payment has been made in full, the buyer shall not have the right to fully or partially pledge the goods to third parties.</p><p>5.3.   The buyer shall keep the goods delivered subject to a reservation of title with due care and as the recognisable property of IMCD Benelux N.V. and shall insure these goods against damage and theft.</p><p>5.4.   In the event of processing of the reserved goods, the buyer acts for IMCD Benelux N.V. The latter’s reservation of title thus extends to the goods created as a result of the processing.</p><p>5.5.   The buyer can nevertheless dispose of the goods under reservation of adequate guarantee. In the event of delivery of goods, the buyer undertakes to keep the counter-value of the goods we delivered &quot;in cash&quot; throughout the title reservation period. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 6 - Complaints.</p><p>6.1.   The correctness of the delivery must be verified upon receipt by the buyer. Errors in the delivery must be mentioned on the delivery note and confirmed in writing to IMCD Benelux N.V. within 24 hours.</p><p>6.2.   Other complaints must be sent to the registered office of IMCD Benelux N.V. immediately and at the latest 8 days after receipt of the goods by registered letter. IMCD Benelux N.V. may at most be obliged to replace the non-conforming delivered goods.</p><p>6.3.   Processed goods are deemed to have been approved by the buyer.</p><p>6.4.   Packaging and content of the non-conforming delivered goods must be stored by the buyer in order to be examined by or returned to IMCD Benelux N.V.</p><p>6.5.   The delivered goods may only be shipped back after receiving prior written authorisation and shipping or other instructions from IMCD Benelux N.V., and within a period of 8 days. The goods remain for the account and risk of the buyer until they are once again safely transferred to IMCD Benelux N.V.</p><p>   If goods are returned without the prior written consent of IMCD Benelux N.V., their dispatch and storage after their return shall be at the buyer’s expense and risk.</p><p>6.6.   A complaint does not relieve the buyer from his payment obligation.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 7 - Payments.</p><p>7.1.   All invoices are payable in cash and without discount at the registered office of IMCD Benelux N.V.</p><p>7.2.   Payment by means of a bill of exchange does not constitute any novation. </p><p>7.3.   As of the due date, any unpaid portion of our invoices bears ipso jure and without reminder a late-payment interest of 1% per month. In addition, the debtor, by application of article 1147 of the Civil Code, will be obliged to pay contractual damages which are established lump-sum and irreducibly at 10% of the outstanding balance, with a minimum of €124 per invoice.</p><p>7.4.   IMCD Benelux N.V. reserves the right, in the event of non-payment of one or several invoices on the due date, or if the buyer ceases to be creditworthy, to suspend all deliveries and cancel the agreements yet to be executed to the disadvantage of the buyer. The buyer will not be able to claim any compensation for this.</p><p>7.5.   In the event of non-payment of one or several invoices, all invoices, including those which are not yet due, become immediately exigible.</p><p>7.6.   All invoices shall be regarded as having been accepted if they were not protested within eight days.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 8 - Warranty.</p><p>8.1.   IMCD Benelux N.V. warrants that the goods sold to the buyer shall at the moment of delivery comply with the specifications as provided by IMCD Benelux N.V. to the buyer for such goods. This warranty will lapse if the buyer fails to fulfil its obligations under the agreement and/or these terms and conditions. Invoking the warranty will not release the buyer from its obligations under the agreement. In case of a breach of the warranty, the buyer&#39;s only remedy is a claim for performance of the agreement by IMCD Benelux N.V.. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 9 - Guarantee.</p><p>9.1.   The guarantee for latent defects of the goods is limited to replacement. The compensation of the proven loss suffered by the buyer may under no circumstances exceed the amount of our sale price of the goods used.</p><p>9.2.   The guarantee for the goods is limited to that provided by the supplier. No other compensation or reimbursement of costs may be claimed from IMCD Benelux N.V.</p><p>9.3.   IMCD Benelux N.V. will not be liable for any damage sustained by the buyer. The guarantee lapses ipso jure if the buyer himself performs transformations, or has such performed by third parties, without our written approval. The same applies if it is determined that the control and processing of the goods is not performed in accordance with the prescriptions of the supplier and/or IMCD Benelux N.V. or if the goods are not used in accordance with the directions for use or the instructions given.</p><p>9.4.   If chemical and technical advice as well as plans and diagrams are provided, whether in writing or orally, IMCD Benelux N.V. assumes only a best-efforts obligation, without guaranteeing any result. Such advice is thus to be regarded merely as guidelines for which no liability can be accepted by IMCD Benelux N.V. The buyer must test the goods himself. </p><p>9.5.   IMCD Benelux N.V. does not guarantee the completeness and accuracy of the information received from its own supplier and given to the buyer and will not be liable for any damage – of whatever nature and in whatever form – incurred as a result of the incompleteness or inaccuracy of this information.</p><p>9.6.   If the buyer resells without processing, he acts at his own risk and without guarantee of continuity. Third-party claims for whatever reason in connection with compensation for any damage in connection with the goods delivered by IMCD Benelux N.V., must be compensated by the buyer.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 10 - Storage.</p><p>10.1.   IMCD Benelux N.V. is not liable for harm caused to goods that are stored on behalf of the buyer as of the moment that they were made available to the buyer.</p><p>10.2.   If the goods, after being made available, continue to be stored in our warehouse for more than one month, IMCD Benelux N.V. shall be entitled to store the goods at the buyer’s expense and risk.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 11 - Intellectual property.</p><p>11.1.   The agreement does not entail any transfer or licensing of any intellectual property right to the buyer. The buyer is not authorised to sell his own or other goods under any product name or trademarks of IMCD Benelux N.V. without prior written consent. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 12 - Compliance with laws.</p><p>12.1.   The buyer shall comply with all applicable laws relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, laws relating to  export control, customs regulations and any obligations it may have under the REACH regulation.</p><p>12.2.    The buyer shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in performing its obligations under the agreement in a manner consistent with the IMCD Code of Conduct. The buyer confirms to have read and agreed to the IMCD Code of Conduct which is available at the following website: www.imcdgroup.com. The buyer shall procure that any third party down the supply chain to whom the goods from IMCD Benelux N.V. will be supplied, are under the same obligations set out in the IMCD Code of Conduct. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 13 - Suspension and termination.</p><p>13.1.   IMCD Benelux N.V. may suspend the fulfilment of its obligations under the agreement either wholly or in part or terminate the agreement either wholly or in part out of court by means of a written notification, without any obligation to pay compensation, in the event that (there is a reasonable expectation that):</p><p>   a)   the buyer materially fails to fulfil one of its obligations under the agreement, such as its obligation to pay on time and in full;</p><p>      b)   an attachment is made against the buyer;</p><p>      c)   the buyer is granted a moratorium;</p><p>      d)   a petition is filed for the buyer&#39;s bankruptcy, or the buyer is declared bankrupt;</p><p>      e)   the buyer makes a payment arrangement with one or more of its creditors;</p><p>      f)   the buyer dies, is placed under guardianship or put into administration; or</p><p>      g)   the buyer’s business is sold or dissolved.</p><p>13.2.   If one of the situations described in Article 13.1 arises, all amounts owed by the buyer to IMCD Benelux N.V. shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required. </p><p>13.3.      The buyer may not suspend compliance with its obligations under or in connection with the agreement on  whatever grounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 14 – Invalidity</p><p>14.1.   If a clause or provision of the agreement is declared null and void, this nullity shall not affect the validity of the other clauses and provisions of the agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 15 - Applicable law and competent court.</p><p>15.1.   Belgian law shall apply exclusively to the agreement and to any non-contractual obligation arising out of this  agreement.</p><p>15.2.   All disputes arising in connection with this agreement, including disputes concerning the existence and validity    thereof, shall be brought before the courts of Mechelen.</p><p>15.3.   IMCD Benelux N.V. may also opt to resolve the dispute by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Belgian Centre for Arbitration and Mediation (het Belgisch Centrum voor Arbitrage en Mediatie). </p><p><br></p><p>Article 16- Interpretation.</p><p>16.1.   The Dutch text takes priority in the event of a difference of interpretation between the various texts.

Minor variations in stated size, weight, number, colour and other product properties shall not be considered to be defects. Commercial practice shall determine whether variations are minor. </p><p>2.4   IMCD shall be entitled at all times, before starting or continuing its performance, to require security from the Purchaser for the fulfilment of any of its obligations under any Agreement. The security shall be provided in the manner stipulated by IMCD in its sole discretion.</p><p>2.5   If the Purchaser has not provided security within 14 days of a request to that effect, in the manner stipulated by IMCD, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Article 3   DELIVERIES</p><p>3.1   Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery of products shall be ex-works at such premises as IMCD may designate to the Purchaser from time to time (Incoterms EXW).</p><p>3.2   Delivery shall take place in accordance with the definitions of the latest version of the Incoterms. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Incoterms, the Incoterms shall prevail.</p><p>3.3      The risk attached to the products purchased will pass to the Purchaser at the time of delivery. The time of delivery is the time that the products purchased arrive at the place of delivery, even if the Purchaser does not accept the delivery. For delivery ex-works, the time of delivery is the time that IMCD notifies the Purchaser that the products purchased are ready for collection.</p><p>3.4      Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery period   specified and agreed will not be a final deadline. The mere fact that IMCD exceeds the agreed delivery period shall not constitute a breach of contract, shall not result in default or any liability to the Purchaser and shall not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement or to any other remedy for breach of contract.</p><p>3.5      If a delivery period has not been expressly agreed upon, a reasonable delivery period shall apply.</p><p>3.6      IMCD shall have the right at all times to deliver in consignments, and shall always be entitled to invoice for such partial performances separately.</p><p>3.7      If the Purchaser does not accept delivery, or in the case of ex-works delivery does not collect the products delivered within seven days after delivery and/or in the manner stipulated by IMCD, the Purchaser shall be in default without notice of default being required, and IMCD shall in any case be entitled to invoice for and receive the agreed price.

Only if the returnable packaging concerns intermediate bulk containers, the Purchaser will be charged a reasonable rent from 30 days after delivery, in addition to the deposit. This rent shall be charged after the intermediate bulk containers have been returned. IMCD shall have the right to deduct rent from the deposit.</p><p>5.2   The loading or filling of transport equipment and/or packaging made available by the Purchaser shall take place at the Purchaser’s expense and risk.

By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its warranty obligation under Article 7 fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD.</p><p>6.7.   The guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products.</p><p>6.8.   Any claim under this Article 6 shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 7   WARRANTY</p><p>IMCD warrants to the Purchaser that the products sold to the Purchaser shall at the moment of delivery comply with the specifications as provided by IMCD to the Purchaser for such products.

CLAIMS/INSURANCE/RETURNS </p><p>14.1 All claims for damage to or partial loss of goods in transit must be submitted in writing to carrier and Seller or Seller’s Agent within three days of delivery and the delivery note must be endorsed accordingly. </p><p>14.2 All claims for non-delivery of the whole of any consignment, or of any separate package forming part of a consignment must be submitted in writing to the carrier and Seller or Seller’s Agent within seven days of receipt by Buyer or Buyer’s Agent of Seller’s invoice or advice note, whichever is the earlier. </p><p>14.3 As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within seven days of receipt of the goods, Buyer shall examine them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they conform to the contract, and if such goods do not conform, promptly give written notice thereof to Seller with sufficient particulars; Buyer shall permit Seller to investigate the matters relevant to such notification before the remainder of the goods comprised in the same consignment are used or pursing any claim in respect of the goods. 14.4 In the absence of notification as a claim or otherwise in accordance with 14.1, 14.2 or 14.3 above, the goods shall be deemed to have been delivered and accepted in conformity with the contract. </p><p>14.5 The insurance costs shall be payable by IMCD only if provided for by the definitions of an Incoterm declared applicable. In that case, however, IMCD shall not be obliged to do any more with regard to the insurance to be taken out, than to take out insurance up to values equivalent to the net invoice sum. </p><p>14.6 The insurance to be taken out shall insure against normal business risk only, and therefore not against exceptional risks and/or acts of war. The liability of IMCD shall not, in any case, extend beyond the cover provided by the insurance. If IMCD should nonetheless be liable beyond the cover provided by such insurance, the provisions of Article 6 of these Terms and Conditions shall be fully applicable. </p><p>14.7 In the event of damage or loss in transit in cases where risk remains with IMCD, IMCD shall submit a claim to the insurer. After IMCD has received the payment from the insurer, it shall pay relevant sums to Buyer. 14.8 Without duly authorised prior written consent on its part, IMCD shall not be obliged to accept returns from Buyer.

By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its guarantee obligation fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD. </p><p>14.12 The guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products. </p><p>14.13 Any claim under this Article shall in any case lapse once three months have passed since receipt of the products supplied. </p><p><br></p><p>15. TRADE MARKS AND PATENTS </p><p>15.1 Nothing contained in this contract, whether express or implied, shall be deemed to confer any rights upon Buyer to apply any trade mark owned by Seller or any of Seller’s associated companies to any goods supplied under this contract. </p><p>15.2 When goods are made or adapted by Seller in accordance with Buyer’s specifications, Buyer shall indemnify Seller against all costs, claims and expenses incurred by Seller in respect of the infringement or alleged infringement by such goods of any patents, registered designs, trade marks or other rights belonging to third parties. </p><p><br></p><p>16. NON-ASSIGNABILITY This contract is not assignable by Buyer without Seller’s prior consent in writing. </p><p><br></p><p>17.

Astfel de ajustări ale prețurilor nu dau dreptul Cumpărătorului să rezilieze Contractul. Acești factori care determină costurile includ, fără a se limita la prețurile materiilor prime, costurile forței de muncă, costurile asigurărilor sociale, impozitele (inclusiv TVA și alte taxe guvernamentale), taxele de import și export și cursurile de schimb.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Articolul 5 - ECHIPAMENTUL DE TRANSPORT ȘI AMBALAJUL</p><p>5.1 Cu excepția cazului în care se convine altfel, ambalajele returnabile furnizate de IMCD rămân proprietatea IMCD-ului în orice moment și trebuie returnate la IMCD în stare perfectă de utilizare.

,a175E000001tuzJQAQ,EUR,true,,"<p>Article 1 - GENERAL 1.1 Definitions: </p><p><br></p><p>Agreement:          any agreement and/or legal act between IMCD and the Purchaser in connection with the purchase of products by the </p><p>                Purchaser from IMCD. </p><p>IMCD:          IMCD Kenya Limited, having its registered office at C&amp;S House, Plot 2019/10491, Old Embakasi Road, Embakasi, P.O. Box </p><p>         61639-00200, Nairobi, Kenya.   </p><p>the Purchaser:          any legal or natural person that wishes to conclude, concludes or has concluded an Agreement with IMCD, as well as any legal </p><p>    or natural person to which IMCD supplies or has supplied products. Terms and Conditions:    these general terms and conditions of sale of IMCD. </p><p><br></p><p>1.2 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, these Terms and Conditions shall apply to all offers and quotes from IMCD, to the Agreement and to all acts and legal acts between IMCD and the Purchaser. </p><p>1.3 Departures from these Terms and Conditions are only valid if they were expressly agreed in writing. </p><p>1.4 The applicability of general terms and conditions used by the Purchaser or any other general terms and conditions is expressly ruled out. </p><p>1.5 The text of the Agreement shall prevail over these Terms and Conditions in the event of a conflict. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 2 - OFFERS AND AGREEMENTS </p><p>2.1 All offers, quotes and price proposals from IMCD will be subject to contract at all times and may be amended or revoked at any time, regardless of whether they contain a period for acceptance. </p><p>2.2 All verbal supplements, promises or changes shall be binding only if they have been made by authorised people at IMCD. </p><p>2.3 Samples and models shown or provided shall serve as indications only, without the products having to comply with those samples and models. Minor variations in stated size, weight, number, colour and other product properties shall not be considered to be defects. Commercial practice shall determine whether variations are minor. </p><p>2.4 IMCD shall be entitled at all times, before starting or continuing its performance, to require security from the Purchaser for the fulfilment of any of its obligations under any Agreement. The security shall be provided in the manner stipulated by IMCD in its sole discretion. </p><p>2.5 If the Purchaser has not provided security within 14 days of a request to that effect, in the manner stipulated by IMCD, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 3 - DELIVERIES </p><p>3.1 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery of products shall be ex-works at such premises as IMCD may designate to the Purchaser from time to time (Incoterms EXW). </p><p>3.2 Delivery shall take place in accordance with the definitions of the latest version of the Incoterms. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Incoterms, the Incoterms shall prevail. </p><p>3.3 The risk attached to the products purchased will pass to the Purchaser at the time of delivery. The time of delivery is the time that the products purchased arrive at the place of delivery, even if the Purchaser does not accept the delivery. For delivery ex-works, the time of delivery is the time that IMCD notifies the Purchaser that the products purchased are ready for collection. </p><p>3.4 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery period specified and agreed will not be a final deadline. The mere fact that IMCD exceeds the agreed delivery period shall not constitute a breach of contract, shall not result in default or any liability to the Purchaser and shall not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement or to any other remedy for breach of contract. </p><p>3.5 If a delivery period has not been expressly agreed upon, a reasonable delivery period shall apply. </p><p>3.6 IMCD shall have the right at all times to deliver in consignments, and shall always be entitled to invoice for such partial performances separately. </p><p>3.7 If the Purchaser does not accept delivery, or in the case of ex-works delivery does not collect the products delivered within seven days after delivery and/or in the manner stipulated by IMCD, the Purchaser shall be in default without notice of default being required, and IMCD shall in any case be entitled to invoice for and receive the agreed price. IMCD shall then also be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights under the law, to store the products at the Purchaser’s expense and risk, all costs arising therefrom, including but not limited to increases in duties, levies, premiums, taxes and charges, shall be payable by the Purchaser. </p><p>3.8 If a situation provided for in Article 3.7 arises, and, despite being given a reasonable time by IMCD, the Purchaser still fails later to take up the products or fails to do so in time and/or properly, IMCD shall without prejudice to its other rights under the law, these Terms and Conditions and/or the Agreement be released from all its obligations and be entitled to retain the purchase price (if paid) as compensation for the storage costs incurred and against any loss of value which the products have sustained since delivery. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 4 - PRICES </p><p>4.1 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, all prices shall be ex-works. All prices shall be exclusive of VAT, the costs of transporting and/or dispatching the products, other costs incurred in connection with delivery, government levies and/or taxes payable. </p><p>4.2 IMCD shall be entitled at all times to change its prices, on condition that prices already agreed may be changed only if the cost-determining factors on which the prices are based have changed since the Agreement was concluded and prior to delivery. Such price adjustments will not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement. Such cost-determining factors include without limitation raw material prices, labour costs, social security costs, taxes (including VAT and other government levies), import and export duties and exchange rates. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 5 - TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND PACKAGING </p><p>5.1 Unless otherwise agreed, returnable packaging provided by IMCD shall remain the property of IMCD at all times and must be returned to IMCD in perfect condition after use. If the returnable packaging is not returned in perfect condition, IMCD shall no longer be obliged to take back the returnable packaging, and the deposit charged shall not be returned either. Furthermore, the deposit shall not be returned if returnable packaging provided by returned after it has been used by the Purchaser for more than two years. Only if the returnable packaging concerns intermediate bulk containers, the Purchaser will be charged a reasonable rent from 30 days after delivery, in addition to the deposit. This rent shall be charged after the intermediate bulk containers have been returned. IMCD shall have the right to deduct rent from the deposit. </p><p>5.2 The loading or filling of transport equipment and/or packaging made available by the Purchaser shall take place at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. If IMCD should nonetheless be liable, the provisions of Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions shall then be fully applicable. </p><p>5.3 IMCD shall have the right to refuse to load equipment and/or fill packaging if it does not comply with the reasonable safety requirements set by IMCD from time to time. In that case, IMCD shall not be liable for any costs arising from a possible delay. Costs shall also be understood to include the costs referred to in Article 3.7. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 6 - RETURNS, COMPLAINTS AND GUARANTEE </p><p>6.1. Without prior written consent on its part, IMCD shall not be obliged to accept returns from the Purchaser. If products are returned without the prior written consent of IMCD, their dispatch and storage after their return shall be at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. </p><p>6.2. The risk in returned products shall continue to be borne by the Purchaser until IMCD has accepted the return and the returned products in writing, to which acceptance IMCD may attach conditions. </p><p>6.3. The Purchaser shall itself be responsible for checking, or having someone check, the conformity of products during their delivery. Purchaser acknowledges its responsibility to test and effectively evaluate the supplied products to determine the Purchaser’s own satisfaction, whether the product and/or any technical assistance and information provided by IMCD is suitable for Purchaser’s intended uses and applications. Purchaser understands its application-specific analysis must at least include testing to determine suitability from a technical as well as health, safety, and environmental standpoint. </p><p>6.4 Complaints must be made in writing within 14 days of the time of delivery, stating the reasons for the complaint and if possible accompanied by proof, failing which the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the quantity and quality of the products and shall lose any claim against IMCD in respect of defects in the products supplied, subject to the provisions of Article 7 regarding warranties. </p><p>6.5. Complaints about products which have already been treated and/or processed in any way after delivery shall not be accepted. </p><p>6.6. Submitting a complaint will not release the Purchaser from its payment obligations. </p><p>6.7. If a complaint is submitted in time and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, and IMCD is reasonably of the opinion that the complaint is justified, IMCD shall be free to choose either to deliver what is lacking, or to redeliver the products found to be unsound free of charge, or to grant a discount on the price. By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its warranty obligation under Article 7 fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD. </p><p>6.8. The guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products. </p><p>6.9. Any claim under this Article 6 shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 7 - WARRANTY </p><p>IMCD warrants to the Purchaser that the products sold to the Purchaser shall at the moment of delivery comply with the specifications as provided by IMCD to the Purchaser for such products. IMCD does not make any express or implied warranty as to the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of the products. This warranty will lapse if the Purchaser fails to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Invoking the warranty will not release the Purchaser from its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms and Conditions, in case of a breach of the warranty given to the Purchaser in terms of this Article 7, the Purchaser´s only remedy is a claim for specific performance by IMCD of its obligations under such warranty. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 8 - LIABILITY </p><p>8.1. IMCD will not be liable for any damage sustained by the Purchaser, irrespective of whether this damage is the result of failure by IMCD to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions (including the warranty obligation of Article 7), or of any act and/or omission by IMCD itself and/or by others acting on IMCD’s instructions, unless the Purchaser proves that the damage is the result of intentional or wilful recklessness by, exclusively any director or directors of IMCD. </p><p>8.2. Unless otherwise provided by law, IMCD shall not be liable for (i) indirect loss of any kind including special or consequential loss, (ii) lost revenue or profits, or (iii) loss suffered by the Purchaser or by a third party as a result of IMCD, or a person for whom it is liable under the law, committing a non-material breach | of the Agreement. </p><p>8.3. IMCD shall not be liable for damage or loss, of whatever nature and in whatever form, which arises or is incurred after the products delivered by IMCD have been treated and/or processed. </p><p>8.4. IMCD does not guarantee the completeness and accuracy of information received by IMCD from its own supplier and will not be liable for any damage – of whatever nature and in whatever form – incurred as a result of the incompleteness or inaccuracy of this information. </p><p>8.5. The liability of IMCD shall at any event be limited at all times per event, with a series of connected events counting as one event, to the amount that is paid out under IMCD’s business liability insurance policy in the case concerned. </p><p>8.6. The Purchaser must compensate IMCD for, and indemnify it against, all third-party claims, for whatever reason, in connection with compensation for any damage, costs, interest and/or losses which arise in connection with the products delivered by IMCD to the Purchaser, unless and insofar as the Purchaser demonstrates that the claim falls exclusively within IMCD&#39;s area of responsibility. </p><p>8.7. The provisions of this Article shall also apply in favour of all legal or natural persons used by IMCD to perform its obligations under the Agreement. </p><p>8.8. Any claim for damages shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 9 - COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS </p><p>9.1 The Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws including but not limited to laws and conventions relating to (a) competition law, (b) anti-bribery, and anti-corruption, and (c) laws relating to export control and customs regulations such as (i) the rules on embargoed countries, (ii) the restrictions on the sale of products to restricted or denied customers, and (iii) the regime for the control of imports, exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. The Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly utilise, sell, ship or otherwise transfer, the products purchased from IMCD to or through any country, entity or individual as prohibited under national and international regulations. </p><p>9.2 Without prejudice to the other provisions in this Article, the Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in performing its obligations under the Agreement in a manner consistent with the IMCD Code of Conduct. The Purchaser confirms to have read and agrees to the IMCD Code of Conduct which is available at the following website: www.imcdgroup.com. </p><p>9.3 The Purchaser shall procure that any third parties to whom the products from IMCD will be supplied, whether in original form or as intermediate or end-product, are under the same obligations as set out in this Article 9 such that all third parties down the supply chain, as far as the end-user, are under the same strict compliance. </p><p>9.4 The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless IMCD, its officers, employees, agents, and representatives, from and against all damages, losses, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, as a result of any claim, suit, action, proceeding, demand, judgment or settlement arising out of Purchaser’s failure to adhere to the provisions of this Article 9. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Article 10 - FORCE MAJEURE (NON-ATTRIBUTABLE NON-PERFORMANCE) </p><p>10.1 In the event that, due to force majeure, IMCD is prevented from performing the Agreement, or performance becomes more costly, IMCD shall have the right to suspend the Agreement in full or in part for the duration of the force majeure situation, or to terminate the Agreement in full or in part, without judicial intervention and without IMCD being obliged to pay any compensation. </p><p>10.2 The term “force majeure” shall be understood to mean any circumstance, both foreseen and unforeseen, that permanently or temporarily prevents the performance by IMCD of the Agreement. Such circumstances shall in any case be understood to include inability to pay for whatever reason, strikes, excessive staff sickness, interruptions in production, transport problems, fire and other business disruptions, import, export and transportation bans, late or defective delivery by IMCD’s suppliers, and other events beyond the control of IMCD, such as flood, storm, natural and/or nuclear disasters, war and/or threat of war, but also changes in legislation and/or government measures. In addition, IMCD may always rely upon force majeure in the case of unsuitability of products and/or persons used by IMCD to perform the Agreement. </p><p>10.3 If IMCD suspends performance of the Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this Article 10, the Purchaser must, at the request of IMCD, extend any letters of credit prescribed by the Agreement and/or the security required in accordance with Article 2.4 of these Terms and Conditions up to the new delivery date. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 11 - PAYMENT </p><p>11.1 Unless agreed otherwise in writing, payment must be made within 14 days of the invoice date, without any discount and/or setoff, in the currency specified on the invoice. </p><p>11.2 If payment in full is not made within the period stated, the Purchaser shall be in default by operation of law and shall be liable to pay penalty interest which shall be calculated per annum according to a rate of interest equivalent to the Central Bank Rate published by the Central Bank of Kenya. </p><p>11.3 The Purchaser shall fully pay to IMCD its actual judicial and extrajudicial costs, including legal fees, incurred as a result of the Purchaser&#39;s failure to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement in full and/or on time, whereby in any event the Purchaser is obliged for any such failure to pay to IMCD at least extrajudicial costs amounting to 15% of the outstanding amount. </p><p>11.4 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 6.3, complaints about invoicing may only be made within the payment term. Complaints must be submitted in writing. The submission of a complaint shall not suspend the Purchaser’s payment obligation. </p><p>11.5 Payments shall be deducted firstly from judicial costs, extrajudicial collection costs and interest payable, and then from the outstanding principal sums, starting with the oldest outstanding principal sums, regardless of any instructions to the contrary from the Purchaser. </p><p>11.6 The Purchaser will be unable to offset any debt to IMCD against any claim of the Purchaser against IMCD. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 12 - SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION </p><p>12.1 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 10, and without prejudice to the right to claim compensation, IMCD may suspend the fulfilment of its obligations under the Agreement either wholly or in part or terminate the Agreement either wholly or in part out of court by means of a written notification, without any obligation to pay compensation, in the event that (there is a reasonable expectation that): </p><p>a) the Purchaser materially fails to fulfil one of its obligations under the Agreement, such as its obligation to pay on time and in full; b) an attachment is made against the Purchaser; </p><p>c)   the Purchaser is granted a moratorium; </p><p>d)   a petition is filed for the Purchaser&#39;s bankruptcy, or the Purchaser is declared bankrupt; </p><p>e)   the Purchaser makes a payment arrangement with one or more of its creditors; </p><p>f)   the Purchaser dies, is placed under guardianship or put into administration; or </p><p>g)   the Purchaser’s business is sold or dissolved. </p><p>If, in accordance with Article 12.1, IMCD suspends performance of the Agreement, the Purchaser must, at the request of IMCD, extend any letters of credit prescribed by the Agreement and/or security required in accordance with Article 2.4 of these Terms and Conditions up to the new delivery date. </p><p>12.2   If, in accordance with Article 12.1, IMCD terminates the Agreement in whole or in part, IMCD may claim back, as its property, any products delivered but not yet paid for in full, offset against any sums already paid, without prejudice to its right to compensation. </p><p>12.3   If one of the situations described in Article 12.1 arises, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required. </p><p>12.4   The Purchaser may not suspend compliance with its obligations under or in connection with the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions on whatever grounds. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 13 - RESERVATION OF TITLE </p><p>13.1The products which IMCD supplies to the Purchaser will remain the property of IMCD until the Purchaser has paid all amounts, including interest and costs, it owes to IMCD under or in connection with the Agreement.

Commercial practice shall determine whether variations are minor. </p><p>2.4   IMCD shall be entitled at all times, before starting or continuing its performance, to require security from the Purchaser for the fulfilment of any of its obligations under any Agreement. The security shall be provided in the manner stipulated by IMCD in its sole discretion.</p><p>2.5   If the Purchaser has not provided security within 14 days of a request to that effect, in the manner stipulated by IMCD, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 3   DELIVERIES</p><p>3.1   Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery of products shall be ex-works at such premises as IMCD may designate to the Purchaser from time to time (Incoterms EXW).</p><p>3.2   Delivery shall take place in accordance with the definitions of the latest version of the Incoterms. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Incoterms, the Incoterms shall prevail.</p><p>3.3   The risk attached to the products purchased will pass to the Purchaser at the time of delivery. The time of delivery is the time that the products purchased arrive at the place of delivery, even if the Purchaser does not accept the delivery. For delivery ex-works, the time of delivery is the time that IMCD notifies the Purchaser that the products purchased are ready for collection.</p><p>3.4   Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery period specified and agreed will not be a final deadline. The mere fact that IMCD exceeds the agreed delivery period shall not constitute a breach of contract, shall not result in default or any liability to the Purchaser and shall not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement or to any other remedy for breach of contract.</p><p>3.5   If a delivery period has not been expressly agreed upon, a reasonable delivery period shall apply.</p><p>3.6   IMCD shall have the right at all times to deliver in consignments, and shall always be entitled to invoice for such partial performances separately.</p><p>3.7   If the Purchaser does not accept delivery, or in the case of ex-works delivery does not collect the products delivered within seven days after delivery and/or in the manner stipulated by IMCD, the Purchaser shall be in default without notice of default being required, and IMCD shall in any case be entitled to invoice for and receive the agreed price. IMCD shall then also be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights under the law, to store the products at the Purchaser’s expense and risk, all costs arising therefrom, including but not limited to increases in duties, levies, premiums, taxes and charges, shall be payable by the Purchaser. </p><p>3.8   If a situation provided for in Article 3.7 arises, and, despite being given a reasonable time by IMCD, the Purchaser still fails later to take up the products or fails to do so in time and/or properly, IMCD shall without prejudice to its other rights under the law, these Terms and Conditions and/or the Agreement be released from all its obligations and be entitled to retain the purchase price (if paid) as compensation for the storage costs incurred and against any loss of value which the products have sustained since delivery.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 4   PRICES</p><p>4.1   Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, all prices shall be ex-works.

Such price adjustments will not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement. Such cost-determining factors include without limitation raw material prices, labour costs, social security costs, taxes (including VAT and other government levies), import and export duties and exchange rates.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 5   TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND PACKAGING</p><p>5.1   Unless otherwise agreed, returnable packaging provided by IMCD shall remain the property of IMCD at all times and must be returned to IMCD in perfect condition after use. If the returnable packaging is not returned in perfect condition, IMCD shall no longer be obliged to take back the returnable packaging, and the deposit charged shall not be returned either. Furthermore, the deposit shall not be returned if returnable packaging provided by returned after it has been used by the Purchaser for more than two years. Only if the returnable packaging concerns intermediate bulk containers, the Purchaser will be charged a reasonable rent from 30 days after delivery, in addition to the deposit. This rent shall be charged after the intermediate bulk containers have been returned. IMCD shall have the right to deduct rent from the deposit.</p><p>5.2   The loading or filling of transport equipment and/or packaging made available by the Purchaser shall take place at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. If IMCD should nonetheless be liable, the provisions of Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions shall then be fully applicable.</p><p>5.3   IMCD shall have the right to refuse to load equipment and/or fill packaging if it does not comply with the reasonable safety requirements set by IMCD from time to time. In that case, IMCD shall not be liable for any costs arising from a possible delay. Costs shall also be understood to include the costs referred to in Article 3.7.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 6   RETURNS, COMPLAINTS AND GUARANTEE</p><p>6.1.   Without prior written consent on its part, IMCD shall not be obliged to accept returns from the Purchaser.

Complaints must be made in writing within 14 days of the time of delivery, stating the reasons for the complaint and if possible accompanied by proof, failing which the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the quantity and quality of the products and shall lose any claim against IMCD in respect of defects in the products supplied, subject to the provisions of Article 7 regarding warranties.</p><p>6.4.   Complaints about products which have already been treated and/or processed in any way after delivery shall not be accepted.</p><p>6.5.   Submitting a complaint will not release the Purchaser from its payment obligations.</p><p>6.6.   If a complaint is submitted in time and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, and IMCD is reasonably of the opinion that the complaint is justified, IMCD shall be free to choose either to deliver what is lacking, or to redeliver the products found to be unsound free of charge, or to grant a discount on the price. By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its warranty obligation under Article 7 fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD.</p><p>6.7.   The guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products.</p><p>6.8.   Any claim under this Article 6 shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 7   WARRANTY</p><p>IMCD warrants to the Purchaser that the products sold to the Purchaser shall at the moment of delivery comply with the specifications as provided by IMCD to the Purchaser for such products. IMCD does not make any express or implied warranty as to the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of the products. This warranty will lapse if the Purchaser fails to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Invoking the warranty will not release the Purchaser from its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms and Conditions, in case of a breach of the warranty given to the Purchaser in terms of this Article 7, the Purchaser´s only remedy is a claim for specific performance by IMCD of its obligations under such warranty. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Article 8   LIABILITY</p><p>8.1.   IMCD will not be liable for any damage sustained by the Purchaser, irrespective of whether this damage is the result of failure by IMCD to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions (including the warranty obligation of Article 7), or of any act and/or omission by IMCD itself and/or by others acting on IMCD’s instructions, unless the Purchaser proves that the damage is the result of intentional or wilful recklessness by, exclusively any director or directors of IMCD.</p><p>8.2.   Unless otherwise provided by law, IMCD shall never be liable for (i) indirect loss of any kind including special or consequential loss, (ii) lost revenue or profits, or (iii) loss suffered by the Purchaser or by a third party as a result of IMCD, or a person for whom it is liable under the law, committing a non-material breach of the Agreement.</p><p>8.3.   IMCD shall not be liable for damage or loss, of whatever nature and in whatever form, which arises or is incurred after the products delivered by IMCD have been treated and/or processed.</p><p>8.4.   IMCD does not guarantee the completeness and accuracy of information received by IMCD from its own supplier and will not be liable for any damage – of whatever nature and in whatever form – incurred as a result of the incompleteness or inaccuracy of this information.</p><p>8.5.   The liability of IMCD shall at any event be limited at all times per event, with a series of connected events counting as one event, to the amount that is paid out under IMCD’s business liability insurance policy in the case concerned.</p><p>8.6.   The Purchaser must compensate IMCD for, and indemnify it against, all third-party claims, for whatever reason, in connection with compensation for any damage, costs, interest and/or losses which arise in connection with the products delivered by IMCD to the Purchaser, unless and insofar as the Purchaser demonstrates that the claim falls exclusively within IMCD&#39;s area of responsibility. </p><p>8.7.   The provisions of this Article shall also apply in favour of all legal or natural persons used by IMCD to perform the Agreement.</p><p>8.8.   Any claim for damages shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 9   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</p><p>9.1   The Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws and conventions including but not limited to laws relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and laws relating to export control and customs regulations such as (i) the rules on embargoed countries, (ii) the restrictions on the sale of products to restricted or denied customers, and (iii) the regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. The Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly utilise, sell, ship or otherwise transfer, the products purchased from IMCD to or through any country, entity or individual as prohibited under national and international regulations. </p><p>9.2   The Purchaser shall comply with any obligations it may have under REACH and to promptly provide to IMCD such information as may reasonably be required from time to time to ensure IMCD’s compliance with REACH. Purchaser shall reimburse all costs and expenses of IMCD in connection with IMCD’s obligations under REACH arising out of the intended use of the products by Purchaser. All information and data provided by IMCD about the substances in the products are strictly confidential and may only be disclosed by the Purchaser when required under REACH.</p><p>9.3   Without prejudice to the other provisions in this Article 9, the Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in performing its obligations under the Agreement in a manner consistent with the IMCD Code of Conduct. The Purchaser confirms to have read and agreed to the IMCD Code of Conduct which is available at the following website: www.imcdgroup.com. </p><p>9.4   The Purchaser shall procure that any third parties to whom the products from IMCD will be supplied, whether in original form or as intermediate or end-product, are under the same obligations as set out in this Article 9 such that all third parties down the supply chain, as far as the end-user, are under the same strict compliance.</p><p>9.5   The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless IMCD, its officers, employees, agents, and representatives, from and against all damages, losses, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, as a result of any claim, suit, action, proceeding, demand, judgment or settlement arising out of Purchaser’s failure to adhere to the provisions of this Article 9.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 10   FORCE MAJEURE (NON-ATTRIBUTABLE NON-PERFORMANCE)</p><p>10.1   In the event that, due to force majeure, IMCD is prevented from performing the Agreement, or performance becomes more costly, IMCD shall have the right to suspend the Agreement in full or in part for the duration of the force majeure situation, or to terminate the Agreement in full or in part, without judicial intervention and without IMCD being obliged to pay any compensation. </p><p>10.2   The term “force majeure” shall be understood to mean any circumstance, both foreseen and unforeseen, that permanently or temporarily prevents the performance by IMCD of the Agreement. Such circumstances shall in any case be understood to include inability to pay for whatever reason, strikes, excessive staff sickness, interruptions in production, transport problems, fire and other business disruptions, import, export and transportation bans, late or defective delivery by IMCD’s suppliers, and other events beyond the control of IMCD, such as flood, storm, natural and/or nuclear disasters, war and/or threat of war, but also changes in legislation and/or government measures. In addition, IMCD may always rely upon force majeure in the case of unsuitability of products and/or persons used by IMCD to perform the Agreement. </p><p>10.3   If IMCD suspends performance of the Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this Article 10, the Purchaser must, at the request of IMCD, extend any letters of credit prescribed by the Agreement and/or the security required in accordance with Article 2.4 of these Terms and Conditions up to the new delivery date.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 11   PAYMENT</p><p>11.1.   Unless agreed otherwise in writing, payment must be made within 14 days of the invoice date, without any discount and/or setoff, in the currency specified on the invoice.</p><p>11.2.   If payment in full is not made within the period stated, the Purchaser shall be in default by operation of law and shall be liable to pay penalty interest which shall be calculated per annum according to a rate of interest equivalent to the reference rate of interest determined by the Central Bank of Denmark, plus eight percentage points. </p><p>11.3.   The Purchaser shall fully pay to IMCD its actual judicial and extrajudicial costs, including legal fees, incurred as a result of the Purchaser&#39;s failure to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement in full and/or on time, whereby in any event the Purchaser is obliged for any such failure to pay to IMCD at least extrajudicial costs amounting to 15% of the outstanding amount, with a minimum of EUR 125.</p><p>11.4.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 6.3, complaints about invoicing may only be made within the payment term. Complaints must be submitted in writing. The submission of a complaint shall not suspend the Purchaser’s payment obligation.</p><p>11.5.   Payments shall be deducted firstly from judicial costs, extrajudicial collection costs and interest payable, and then from the outstanding principal sums, starting with the oldest outstanding principal sums, regardless of any instructions to the contrary from the Purchaser.</p><p>11.6.   The Purchaser will be unable to offset any debt to IMCD against any claim of the Purchaser against IMCD. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 12   SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION</p><p>12.1   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 10, and without prejudice to the right to claim compensation, IMCD may suspend the fulfilment of its obligations under the Agreement either wholly or in part or terminate the Agreement either wholly or in part out of court by means of a written notification, without any obligation to pay compensation, in the event that (there is a reasonable expectation that):</p><p>   a)   the Purchaser materially fails to fulfil one of its obligations under the Agreement, such as its obligation to pay on time and in full;</p><p>b)   an attachment is made against the Purchaser;</p><p>   c) the Purchaser is granted a moratorium;</p><p>   d) a petition is filed for the Purchaser&#39;s bankruptcy, or the Purchaser is declared bankrupt;</p><p>   e) the Purchaser makes a payment arrangement with one or more of its creditors;</p><p>   f) the Purchaser dies, is placed under guardianship or put into administration; or</p><p>   g) the Purchaser’s business is sold or dissolved.</p><p>If, in accordance with Article 12.1, IMCD suspends performance of the Agreement, the Purchaser must, at the request of IMCD, extend any letters of credit prescribed by the Agreement and/or security required in accordance with Article 2.4 of these Terms and Conditions up to the new delivery date.</p><p>12.2   If, in accordance with Article 12.1, IMCD terminates the Agreement in whole or in part, IMCD may claim back, as its property, any products delivered but not yet paid for in full, offset against any sums already paid, without prejudice to its right to compensation. </p><p>12.3   If one of the situations described in Article 12.1 arises, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required. </p><p>12.4   The Purchaser may not suspend compliance with its obligations under or in connection with the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions on whatever grounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 13   RESERVATION OF TITLE</p><p>13.1   The products which IMCD supplies to the Purchaser will remain the property of IMCD until the Purchaser has paid all amounts, including interest and costs, it owes to IMCD under or in connection with the Agreement.</p><p>13.2   Before payment has been made in full, the Purchaser shall not have the right to fully or partially pledge the products to third parties.

The mere fact that IMCD exceeds the agreed delivery period for a time period of 30 working days shall not constitute a breach of contract, shall not result in default or any liability to the Purchaser and shall not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement.</p><p>3.5 If a delivery period has not been expressly agreed upon, a reasonable delivery period shall apply.</p><p>3.6 IMCD shall have the right at all times to deliver in consignments, and shall always be entitled to invoice for such partial performances separately.</p><p>3.7 The Purchaser shall be obliged to accept delivery in case the delivered products do not deviate considerably from any agreed specification and/or do not possess more than minor defects or deficiencies which affect the common use of such products. If the Purchaser does not take over delivery, or in the case of ex-works delivery does not collect the products delivered in the manner stipulated by IMCD, IMCD shall in any case invoice for the agreed price. IMCD shall be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights under the law, to store the products at the Purchaser’s expense and risk, and all costs arising therefrom, including increases in duties, levies, premiums and the suchlike, shall be payable by the Purchaser.</p><p>3.8 If a situation provided for in Article 3.7 arises, IMCD shall, without further notice required, be entitled to withdraw from the agreement. In that case, IMCD may offset the refund of the purchase price (if paid) against the storage costs incurred and against any loss of value which the products have sustained since delivery.</p><p>Article 4 - PRICES</p><p>4.1 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, all prices shall be ex-works. All prices shall be exclusive of VAT, the costs of transporting and/or dispatching the products, other costs incurred in connection with delivery, government levies and/or taxes payable.</p><p>4.2 IMCD shall be entitled at all times to change its prices, on condition that prices already agreed may be changed only if the cost-determining factors on which the prices are based have changed since the Agreement was concluded and prior to delivery. Such price adjustments will not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement. Such cost-determining factors include without limitation raw material prices, labour costs, social security costs, taxes (including VAT and other government levies), import and export duties and exchange rates.</p><p>Article 5 - TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND PACKAGING</p><p>5.1 Unless otherwise agreed, returnable packaging provided by IMCD shall remain the property of IMCD at all times and must be returned to IMCD in perfect condition after use. If the returnable packaging is not returned in perfect condition, IMCD shall no longer be obliged to take back the returnable packaging, and the deposit charged shall not be returned either. Furthermore, the deposit shall not be returned if returnable packaging provided by IMCD is returned after it has been used by the Purchaser for more than two years. Only if the returnable packaging concerns intermediate bulk containers, the Purchaser will be charged a reasonable rent from 30 working days after delivery, in addition to the deposit. This rent shall be charged after the intermediate bulk containers have been returned. IMCD shall have the right to deduct rent from the deposit.</p><p>5.2 The loading or filling of transport equipment and/or packaging made available by the Purchaser shall take place at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. If IMCD should nonetheless be liable, the provisions of Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions shall then be fully applicable.</p><p>5.3 IMCD shall have the right to refuse to load equipment and/or fill packaging if it does not fulfil reasonable safety requirements set by IMCD. In that case, IMCD shall not be liable for any costs arising from a possible delay. Costs shall also be understood to include the costs referred to in Article 3.7.</p><p>Article 6 - RETURNS, COMPLAINTS AND GUARANTEE</p><p>6.1 Without prior written consent on its part, IMCD shall not be obliged to accept returns from the Purchaser. If products are returned without the prior written consent of IMCD, their dispatch and storage after their return shall be at the Purchaser’s expense and risk.</p><p>6.2 The risk in returned products shall continue to be borne by the Purchaser until IMCD has accepted the return and the returned products in writing, to which acceptance IMCD may attach conditions.</p><p>6.3 The Purchaser shall itself be responsible for checking, or having someone check, the conformity of products during their delivery. Purchaser acknowledges its responsibility to test and effectively evaluate the supplied products to determine the Purchaser’s own satisfaction, whether the product and/or any technical assistance and information provided by IMCD is suitable for Purchaser’s intended uses and applications. Purchaser understands its application-specific analysis shall at least include testing to determine suitability from a technical as well as health, safety, and environmental standpoint.</p><p>6.4 The Purchaser shall make complaints about the delivered products in writing within 14 days of the time of delivery, stating the reasons for the complaint and if possible accompanied by proof, failing which the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the quantity and quality of the products and shall lose any claim against IMCD in respect of defects in the products supplied, subject to the provisions of Article 7 regarding warranties.</p><p>6.5 Complaints about products which have already been treated and/or processed in any way after delivery shall not be accepted.</p><p>6.6 Submitting a complaint will not release the Purchaser from its payment obligations.</p><p>6.7 If a complaint is submitted in time and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the law, and IMCD is reasonably of the opinion that the complaint is justified, IMCD shall be free to choose either to deliver what is lacking, or to redeliver the products found to be unsound free of charge, to repair or to grant a discount on the price. By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its respective obligation fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD.</p><p>6.8 Any warranty or, as the case may be, guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the warranty and/or, as the case may be, guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products.</p><p>6.9 Any claim under this Article 6 shall in any case lapse six months after the time of delivery.</p><p>Article 7 - WARRANTY</p><p>IMCD warrants that the products sold to the Purchaser shall at the moment of delivery comply with the specifications as provided by IMCD to the Purchaser for such products. IMCD does not make any express or implied warranty as to the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of the products. IMCD shall therefore solely be responsible for defects affecting the usability of the products to the extent that these defects are the result of defective materials or manufacturing. Obvious defects and deficiencies must be reported to IMCD in writing within 5 working days after receipt of the products and hidden defects within 5 working days after discovery as otherwise any claim shall be forfeited. Any warranty or other responsibility in regard the quality of the goods shall be excluded, in case a defect is the consequence of a failure in the Purchaser’s compliance with IMCD’s operation and maintenance instructions, and/or natural wear and tear in view of their material substance, and/or modifications or reparations that have been made without IMCD’s written consent. This warranty will lapse if the Purchaser fails to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Invoking the warranty will not release the Purchaser from its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. In case of a breach of the warranty, the Purchaser&#39;s only remedy is a claim for performance of the Agreement by IMCD.</p><p>Article 8 - LIABILITY</p><p>8.1 IMCD will not be liable for any damage sustained by the Purchaser, irrespective of whether this damage is the result of failure by IMCD to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions (including the warranty obligation of Article 7), or of any act and/or omission by IMCD itself and/or by others acting on IMCD’s instructions, unless the Purchaser proves that the damage was caused by IMCD intentionally or by grievous gross negligence.</p><p>8.2 IMCD shall never be liable for indirect loss of any kind including consequential loss and lost profits, and non-material loss suffered by the Purchaser or by a third party as a result of IMCD, or a person for whom it is liable under the law, failing in the performance of the Agreement.</p><p>8.3 IMCD shall not be liable for damage, of whatever nature and in whatever form, which arises after the products delivered by IMCD have been treated and/or processed.</p><p>8.4 IMCD does not guarantee the completeness and accuracy of information received by IMCD from its own supplier and will not be liable for any damage – of whatever nature and in whatever form – incurred as a result of the incompleteness or inaccuracy of this information.</p><p>8.5 The liability of IMCD shall at any event be limited at all times per event, with a series of connected events counting as one event, to the amount that is paid out under IMCD’s business liability insurance policy in the case concerned.</p><p>8.6 The Purchaser must compensate IMCD for, and indemnify it against, all third-party claims, for whatever reason, in connection with compensation for any damage, costs, interest and/or losses which arise in connection with the products delivered by IMCD to the Purchaser, unless and insofar as the Purchaser demonstrates that the claim falls exclusively within IMCD&#39;s area of responsibility.</p><p>8.7 The provisions of this Article shall also apply in favour of all legal or natural persons used by IMCD to perform the Agreement.</p><p>8.8 Any claim for damages shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery.</p><p>Article 9 - COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</p><p>9.1 The Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws including but not limited to laws relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption such as the 2010 Bribery Act of the United Kingdom, and laws relating to export control and customs regulations such as (i) the rules on embargoed countries, (ii) the restrictions on the sale of products to restricted or denied customers, and (iii) the regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. The Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly utilise, sell, ship or otherwise transfer, the products purchased from IMCD to or through any country, entity or individual as prohibited under national and international regulations. </p><p>9.2 The Purchaser shall comply with any obligations it may have under REACH and to promptly provide to IMCD such information as may reasonably be required from time to time to ensure IMCD’s compliance with REACH. Purchaser shall reimburse all costs and expenses of IMCD in connection with IMCD’s obligations under REACH arising out of the intended use of the products by Purchaser. All information and data provided by IMCD about the substances in the products are strictly confidential and may only be disclosed by the Purchaser when required under REACH.</p><p>9.3 Without prejudice to the other provisions in this Article 9, the Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in performing its obligations under the Agreement in a manner consistent with the IMCD Code of Conduct. The Purchaser confirms to have read and agreed to the IMCD Code of Conduct, which is available at the following website: www.imcdgroup.com.</p><p>9.4 The Purchaser shall procure that any third parties to whom the products from IMCD will be supplied, whether in original form or as intermediate or end-product, are under the same obligations as set out in this Article 9 such that all third parties down the supply chain, as far as the end-user, are under the same strict compliance.</p><p>9.5 The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless IMCD, its officers, employees, agents, and representatives, from and against all damages, losses, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, as a result of any claim, suit, action, proceeding, demand, judgment or settlement arising out of Purchaser’s failure to adhere to the provisions of this Article 9.</p><p>Article 10 - FORCE MAJEURE (NON-ATTRIBUTABLE NON-PERFORMANCE)</p><p>10.1 In the event that, due to force majeure, IMCD is prevented from performing the Agreement, or performance becomes more costly, IMCD shall have the right to suspend the Agreement in full or in part for the duration of the force majeure situation, or to terminate the Agreement in full or in part, without judicial intervention and without IMCD being obliged to pay any compensation.</p><p>10.2 The term “force majeure” shall be understood to mean any circumstance, both foreseen and unforeseen, that permanently or temporarily prevents the performance by IMCD of the Agreement. Such circumstances shall in any case be understood to include inability to pay for whatever reason, strikes, excessive staff sickness, interruptions in production, transport problems, fire and other business disruptions, import, export and transportation bans, late or defective delivery by IMCD’s suppliers, and other events beyond the control of IMCD, such as flood, storm, natural and/or nuclear disasters, war and/or threat of war, but also changes in legislation and/or government measures. In addition, IMCD may always rely upon force majeure in the case of unsuitability of products and/or persons used by IMCD to perform the Agreement.</p><p>10.3 If IMCD suspends performance of the Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this Article 10, the Purchaser must, at the request of IMCD, extend any letters of credit prescribed by the Agreement and/or the security required in accordance with Article 2.4 of these Terms and Conditions up to the new delivery date.</p><p>Article 11 - PAYMENT</p><p>11.1 Unless agreed otherwise in writing, payment must be made within 14 days of the invoice date, without any discount and/or setoff, in the currency specified on the invoice.</p><p>11.2 If payment in full is not made within the period stated, the Purchaser shall be in default by operation of law and shall be liable to pay interest at the rate of 10% per annum on the amount outstanding as from the day of the default until the day of payment in full. If the statutory commercial interest is more than 10%, the Purchaser shall be liable to pay the statutory commercial interest (pursuant to the relevant section of the Austrian “UGB Unternehmensgesetzbuch”).</p><p>11.3 The Purchaser shall fully pay to IMCD its actual judicial and extrajudicial costs, including legal fees, incurred as a result of the Purchaser&#39;s failure to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement in full and/or on time, whereby in any event the Purchaser is obliged for any such failure to pay to IMCD at least extrajudicial costs amounting to 15% of the outstanding amount, with a minimum of EUR 125.</p><p>11.4 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 6.3 and Article 6.4, complaints about invoicing may only be made within the payment term. Complaints must be submitted in writing. The submission of a complaint shall not suspend the Purchaser’s payment obligation.</p><p>11.5 Payments shall be deducted firstly from judicial costs, extrajudicial collection costs and interest payable, and then from the outstanding principal sums, starting with the oldest outstanding principal sums, regardless of any instructions to the contrary from the Purchaser.</p><p>11.6 The Purchaser will be unable to offset any debt to IMCD against any claim of the Purchaser against IMCD.</p><p>Article 12 - SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION</p><p>12.1 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 10, and without prejudice to the right to claim compensation, IMCD may suspend the fulfilment of its obligations under the Agreement either wholly or in part or terminate the Agreement either wholly or in part out of court by means of a written notification, without any obligation to pay compensation, in the event that (there is a reasonable expectation that):</p><p>a) the Purchaser materially fails to fulfil one of its obligations under the Agreement, such as its obligation to pay on time and in full;</p><p> b) an attachment is made against the Purchaser;</p><p> c) the Purchaser is granted a moratorium;</p><p> d) a petition is filed for the Purchaser&#39;s bankruptcy, or the Purchaser is declared bankrupt;</p><p> e) the Purchaser makes a payment arrangement with one or more of its creditors;</p><p> f) the Purchaser dies, is placed under guardianship or put into administration; or</p><p> g) the Purchaser’s business is sold or dissolved.</p><p>12.2 If, in accordance with Article 12.1, IMCD suspends performance of the Agreement, the Purchaser must, at the request of IMCD, extend any letters of credit prescribed by the Agreement and/or security required in accordance with Article 2.4 of these Terms and Conditions up to the new delivery date.</p><p>12.3 If, in accordance with Article 12.1, IMCD terminates the Agreement in whole or in part, IMCD may claim back, as its property, any products delivered but not yet paid for in full, offset against any sums already paid, without prejudice to its right to compensation.</p><p>12.4 If one of the situations described in Article 12.1 arises, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required.</p><p>12.5 The Purchaser may not suspend compliance with its obligations under or in connection with the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions on whatever grounds.</p><p>Article 13 - RESERVATION OF TITLE</p><p>13.1 The products which IMCD supplies to the Purchaser will remain the property of IMCD until the Purchaser has paid all amounts, including interest and costs, it owes to IMCD under or in connection with the Agreement.</p><p>13.2 Before payment has been made in full, the Purchaser shall not have the right to fully or partially pledge the products to third parties. Purchaser shall further not have the right to transfer ownership of the products, other than in accordance with its normal activities or the normal use of the products.</p><p>13.3 The Purchaser shall keep the products delivered subject to a reservation of title with due care and as the recognizable property of IMCD and shall insure these products against damage and theft.</p><p>13.4 If one of the situations described in Article 12.1 arises, IMCD shall have the right to take back itself, or have someone else take back, the products which are its property, at the Purchaser’s expense, from the place where they are located. The Purchaser will cooperate fully and hereby authorizes IMCD irrevocably, if that situation arises, to enter, or have someone enter, the premises in use by or for the Purchaser.</p><p>13.5 The Purchaser shall not be permitted to rely upon a right of retention with regard to the costs incurred in connection with the safekeeping pursuant to Article 13.3, or to offset those costs against its performance.</p><p>13.6 If the Purchaser forms a new product from, or partly from, the products delivered to it by IMCD, IMCD shall have co-ownership title and rights on the new product in proportion of the value of the products processed or mixed in relation to the new product. Furthermore, the Purchaser shall keep (part of) the product for IMCD, and IMCD shall always remain the owner equal to its share of co-ownership until all the obligations referred to Article 13.1 have been fulfilled.</p><p>Article 14 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</p><p>14.1 The Agreement and these Terms and Conditions do not entail any transfer or licensing of any intellectual property rights to the Purchaser.</p><p>14.2 The Purchaser warrants to IMCD at all times and indemnifies IMCD in this respect that the use by IMCD of data, specifications or material provided by the Purchaser does not breach any statutory regulation or infringe third-party rights.</p><p>Article 15 - CONFIDENTIALITY</p><p>If IMCD discloses or grants to the Purchaser access to any research, development, technical, economic, or other business information or &quot;know-how&quot; of a confidential nature, whether reduced to writing or not, Purchaser shall treat this information as strictly confidential and shall not, directly or indirectly, make use of any such information or disclose such information to any third party at any time, without IMCD&#39;s prior written consent. In the event that Purchaser and IMCD have entered into a separate confidentiality agreement, the terms and conditions of such agreement shall take precedence over the terms of this Article.</p><p>Article 16 - INVALIDITY AND CONVERSION</p><p>If any provision in the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions is held to be or becomes illegal, invalid, not binding or unenforceable (in each case either in its entirety or in part) under any law of any jurisdiction:</p><p>a) that provision shall to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, lack of binding effect or unenforceability be deemed not to form part of this agreement but the</p><p>legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability of the remainder of the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions shall not be affected; and</p><p>b) a provision will apply between IMCD and the Purchaser which is legal, valid, binding and enforceable which is as similar as possible in terms of contents and purpose.</p><p>Article 17 - APPLICABLE LAW AND COMPETENT COURT</p><p>Austrian law shall apply exclusively to all Agreements and to these Terms and Conditions, including this Article 17, and to any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions. Applicability of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is explicitly ruled out. All disputes arising in connection with this agreement, including disputes concerning the existence and validity thereof, shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the ICC Court of Arbitration in Paris. In that connection, the following applies:</p><p>a) the place of arbitration shall be Vienna.</p><p>b) the tribunal shall decide in accordance with the rules of law.</p><p>c) the ICC Court of Arbitration in Paris may not have the arbitral judgment published.</p><p>IMCD may also bring any dispute as described in this Article 17 before the court competent for matters of commercial law in Vienna, Austria.</p>",All,false,1,Approved,AT SL,,a0t5E000002gGw2QAE

Dohoda nebo přijetí objednávky Kupujícího, a to i když předchozí praxe mezi stranami byla odlišná, jsou pro IMCD závazné až v okamžiku jejich písemného potvrzení ze strany IMCD. To neplatí v případě, dodá-li IMCD Kupujícímu požadované zboží bez dalšího.</p><p>2.3 Vzorky a předlohy zboží, předvedené či jinak poskytnuté, slouží výhradně jako vzor, a zboží nemusí těmto vzorkům a předlohám odpovídat. Menší odchylky ve stanovené velikosti, váze, čísle, barvě a obdobných vlastnostech se nepovažují za vady. Obchodní praxe určí, kdy se jedná o menší odchylky.</p><p>2.4 Před započetím s plněním či před pokračováním v plnění je IMCD oprávněna požadovat od Kupujícího zajištění splnění jakékoli jeho povinnosti vyplývající z jakékoli Dohody.

Okamžikem dodání je okamžik, kdy zboží dorazí na místo dodání, a to i v případě, že je Kupující nepřevezme. V případě dodání ze závodu (ex works) se okamžikem dodání rozumí okamžik, kdy IMCD oznámí Kupujícímu, že je kupované zboží připraveno k vyzvednutí.</p><p>3.4 Není-li písemně výslovně dohodnuto jinak, není stanovená a ujednaná dodací lhůta konečným termínem. Samotná skutečnost, že IMCD překročí ujednanou dodací lhůtu až o 30 pracovních dní, nezakládá podstatné porušení smlouvy, stav prodlení ani povinnost k náhradě škody vůči Kupujícícímu a neopravňuje Kupujícího k odstoupení od Dohody.</p><p>3.5 Nedošlo-li k výslovné dohodě o délce dodací lhůty, platí lhůta přiměřená. </p><p>3.6 IMCD je oprávněna zboží dodávat po částech a je vždy oprávněna takováto částečná plnění samostatně fakturovat.</p><p>3.7 Kupující je povinen převzít dodávku, neodchyluje-li se zboží výrazně od dohodnutých podmínek, zejména v množství a jakosti a/nebo nemáli-li zboží větší než drobné vady nebo nedostatky mající vliv na běžné užívání tohoto zboží. V případě, že Kupující dodávku neoprávněně nepřevezme, nebo v případě dodávky ze závodu si zboží, způsobem stanoveným IMCD neoprávněně nevyzvedne, vystaví IMCD fakturu vždy na ujednanou cenu a Kupující je povinen k úhradě plné výše ujednané kupní ceny. IMCD je oprávněna, aniž by byla dotčena její jiná práva vyplývající z právních předpisů, uskladnit zboží na náklady a nebezpečí Kupujícího, přičemž veškeré náklady s tím spojené, včetně navýšených daní, odvodů, pojistného a podobných, nese Kupující. IMCD je oprávněna uskladněné zboží zadržet, dokud Kupující neuhradí veškeré náklady spojené s jeho uskladněním.</p><p>3.8 Nastane-li situace dle článku 3.7, je IMCD bez nutnosti dalšího upozornění oprávněna od Dohody odstoupit. V takovém případě si může IMCD započíst proti vrácení kupní ceny (byla-li zaplacena) vzniklé náklady na uskladnění a částku odpovídající ztrátě hodnoty zboží, které zboží od jeho dodání utrpělo.</p><p>Článek 4 - CENY</p><p>4.1 Není-li výslovně písemně dohodnuto jinak, jsou všechny ceny uváděny jako EXW. Všechny ceny jsou uváděny bez DPH, nákladů na dopravu a/nebo expedici zboží, a jakýchkoli dalších nákladů vzniklých v souvislosti s dodáním, státních odvodů a daní.</p><p>4.2 IMCD je oprávněna kdykoli změnit své ceny s tím, že ceny již ujednané mohou být měněny pouze v případě, že se v době od uzavření Dohody změní faktory, od nichž jsou ceny odvislé, a stane-li se tak ještě před dodáním zboží. Takovéto změny cen neopravňují Kupujícího k odstoupení od Dohody. Mezi faktory, od nichž jsou ceny odvislé, patří ceny surovin, náklady na pracovní sílu, náklady na sociální zabezpečení, daně (včetně DPH a dalších odvodů státu), dovozní a vývozní cla a směnné kurzy.</p><p>Článek 5 - DOPRAVA A BALENÍ</p><p>5.1 Není-li dohodnuto jinak, vratné obaly poskytnuté od IMCD zůstávají vlastnictvím IMCD a po použití musí být vráceny IMCD v bezvadném stavu. V případě, že vratný obal není vrácen v bezvadném stavu, není IMCD povinna jej přijmout, ani nebude vrácena uhrazená vratná záloha. Dále vratná záloha nebude vrácena v případě, kdy je vratný obal poskytnutý ze strany IMCD vrácen až poté, co byl Kupujícím používán po dobu delší než dva roky. Pouze v případech, kdy je takovýmto vratným obalem IBC kontejner, bude Kupujícímu účtováno vedle vratné zálohy navíc i přiměřené nájemné, a to od 30. pracovního dne po jeho dodání. Toto nájemné bude vyúčtováno poté, co budou IBC kontejnery vráceny. IMCD má právo na odečtení výše dlužného nájemného z vratné zálohy.</p><p>5.2 Nakládání a plnění dopravních prostředků a/nebo obalů poskytnutných Kupujícím se děje na náklady a nebezpečí Kupujícího. Pokud by však i přesto měla IMCD nést odpovědnost, uplatní se plně ustanovení článku 7 těchto Obchodních podmínek.</p><p>5.3 IMCD má právo odmítnout nakládání dopravních prostředků a/nebo naplnění obalů, nesplňují-li přiměřené bezpečnostní požadavky stanovené IMCD. V takovýchto případech nenese IMCD odpovědnost za náklady vzniklé v důsledku možného prodlení. Pod pojmem náklady se rozumí i náklady vyjmenované v článku 3.7.</p><p>Článek 6 - PRÁVA Z VADNÉHO PLNĚNÍ</p><p>6.1 Pokud dodané zboží neodpovídá co do množství, jakosti, provedení nebo balení ujednaným podmínkám, má zboží vady. Vady zboží je Kupující povinen IMCD důvěryhodným způsobem prokázat.</p><p>6.2 IMCD nenese odpovědnost za:</p><p> - prodejnost zboží nebo vhodnost zboží k učitému použití;</p><p>- vady vzniklé v důsledku nedodržení provozních a servisních pokynů IMCD Kupujícím;</p><p>- vady, které jsou důsledkem běžného opotřebení zboží vzhledem ke složení materiálu;</p><p>- vady, které jsou důsledkem oprav či úprav zboží provedených bez písemného souhlasu IMCD.</p><p>6.3 Kupující je povinen prohlédnout nebo zajistit prohlídku zboží při převzetí. Kupující je zodpovědný za prohlídku a zhodnocení dodaného zboží za účelem zjištění, zda zboží a/nebo technická podpora a informace poskytnuté IMCD odpovídají zamýšlenému užití zboží Kupujícím. Kupující je srozuměn s tím, že prohlídka zboží ve vztahu k jeho obvyklému užití zahrnuje přinejmenší ověření vhodnosti zboží z hlediska technického, zdravotního, bezpečnostního a ekologického.</p><p>6.4 Oznámení vady dodaného zboží je Kupující povinen učinit písemně ve lhůtě 14 dnů od jeho dodání, a to tak, aby obsahovalo důvody doplněné, je-li to možné, o důkazy. V opačném případě platí, že ze strany Kupujícího došlo k přijetí dodaného množství zboží a jeho kvality a Kupující ztrácí jákekoli nároky z vadného plnění vůči IMCD s výjimkou nároků uvedených v Článku 7, vztahujícího se na odpovědnost za škodu.</p><p>6.5 Vady zboží je Kupující povinen oznámit IMCD nejpozději do 5 pracovních dnů od provedení prohlídky.</p><p>6.6 Skryté vady je Kupující povinen oznámit do 5 pracovních dnů poté, co je mohl při dostatečné péči zjistit, nejpozději však do 6 měsíců od okamžiku dodání zboží (přechod nebezpečí škody).</p><p>6.7 Po uplynutí lhůt k oznámení vady práva Kupujícího z vadného plnění zanikají.</p><p>6.8 Byly-li vady řádně a včas oznámeny (prostřednictvím reklamace), IMCD sdělí Kupujícímu do 30 pracovních dnů od obdržení písemného oznámení vad Kupujícího návrh dalšího postupu řešení reklamace nebo reklamaci odmítne. IMCD je oprávněna reklamaci odmítnout i po této lhůtě, pokud se prokáže jako neoprávněná.</p><p>6.9 Kupující je povinen uskladnit zboží, ohledně něhož uplatňuje práva z vadného plnění, odděleně od ostatního zboží a nesmí se zbožím jakkoli nakládat, jinak má IMCD právo reklamaci odmítnout.</p><p>6.10 Je-li IMCD písemně reklamace uznána jako oprávněná, má Kupující právo na</p><p>a) odstranění vady dodáním chybějícího zboží nebo dodáním nového zboží bez vady,</p><p>b) na odstranění vady opravou zboží, nebo</p><p>c) na přiměřenou slevu z kupní ceny.</p><p> O způsobu řešení reklamace rozhoduje výlučně IMCD. Kupujcí je oprávněn od Dohody odstoupit pouze v případě, že dodáním vadného zboží byla Dohoda porušena podstatným způsobem. Právo odstoupit od smlouvy však nevzniká, pokud Kupující není schopen vrátit zboží ve stavu, v jakém je obdržel.</p><p>6.11 Smluvní strany vylučující použití § 2108 zákona č. 89/2012 Sb., občanský zákoník.</p><p>6.12 V případě dodání náhradního zboží nebo v případě odstoupení Kupujícího od Dohody je Kupující povinen vrátit IMCD zboží ve stavu, v jakém je převzal. Kupující není oprávněn bez výslovného písemného souhlasu IMCD vrátit zboží IMCD před skončením reklamačního řízení. Vrátí-li Kupující zboží před skončením reklamačního řízení bez výslovného souhlasu IMCD, nese nebezpečí škody na věci a veškeré náklady související s vrácením a ukladněním zboží.</p><p>6.13 Nebezpečí škody na zboží nese nadále Kupující, a to až do doby, kdy IMCD písemně schválí jeho vrácení a přijme vrácené zboží, přičemž si IMCD vyhrazuje právo přijetí zboží podmínit splněním určitých podmínek Kupujícím.</p><p>6.14 Poruší-li Kupující svou povinnost dle Dohody a/nebo těchto Obchodních podmínek, např. povinnost včasné prohlídky zboží nebo oznámení vad IMCD, je IMCD oprávněna reklamaci odmítnout.</p><p>6.15 Uplatňování práv z vadného plnění nezprošťuje Kupujícího jeho závazků vyplývajících z Dohody a/nebo těcho Obchodních podmínek.</p><p>Článek 7 - ODPOVĚDNOST ZA ŠKODU</p><p>7.1 IMCD není odpovědná za škodu vzniklou Kupujícímu, bez ohledu na to, zda tato škoda nebo újma byla důsledkem porušení povinností z Dohody a/nebo těchto Obchodních podmínek ze strany IMCD či důsledkem jakéhokoli jednání a/nebo opomenutí IMCD samotné či kohokoli jednajícího podle pokynů IMCD, ledaže Kupující prokáže, že IMCD tuto škodu způsobila úmyslně či z hrubé nedbalosti.</p><p>7.2 IMCD není odpovědná za nepřímou škodu jakéhokoli druhu včetně následné škody, ušlého zisku a nemateriální újmy způsobené Kupujícímu či třetí straně neplněním Dohody ze strany IMCD či osoby, za kterou odpovídá.</p><p>7.3 IMCD nenese odpovědnost za jakoukoli škodu vzniklou Kupujícímu, která vznikne poté, co po dodání bylo se zbožím nakládáno a/nebo bylo zpracováno.</p><p>7.4 IMCD neručí za úplnost a přesnost informací o zboží poskytnutých IMCD jejím dodavatelem, a nenese odpovědnost za jakoukoli škodu způsobenou neúplností či nepřesností těchto informací.</p><p>7.5 Odpovědnost IMCD v každém případě, či v případě souvisejícíh případů počítajících se jako jeden případ, je vždy omezena do výše částky vyplácené v rámci obchodního pojištění IMCD v dotčeném případě.</p><p>7.6 Kupující musí IMCD poskytnout náhradu za a odškodnit ji za jakékoli nároky třetích stran existující z jakéhokoli důvodu v souvislosti s náhradou škody, nákladů, úroků a/nebo ztrát vzniklých v souvislosti s výrobky dodanými IMCD Kupujícímu, ledaže Kupující prokáže, že ten který nárok základá výlučně odpovědnost IMCD.</p><p>7.7 Ustanovení tohoto článku se uplatní též ve prospěch všech právnických či fyzických osob, jež IMCD používá pro plnění Dohody.</p><p>7.8 Veškeré nároky na náhradu škody zanikají 1 rok od okamžiku, kdy se poškozená strana dozví o škodě a o osobě povinné k její náhradě.</p><p>Článek 8 - SOULAD S PRÁVNÍMI PŘEDPISY</p><p>8.1 Kupující jedná v souladu s veškerými příslušnými zákonnými i podzákonnými právními normami, včetně předpisů mezinárodního práva a práva Evropské Unie, předpisů proti úplatkářství a korupci, zejména zákonem č. 253/2008 Sb., o některých opatřeních proti legalizaci výnosů z trestné činnosti a financování terorismu, a předpisů regulujících vývoz a dovoz zboží. Kupující nesmí přímo ani nepřímo prodávat, dopravovat, či jinak převádět výrobky získané od IMCD do států, celkům či jednotlivcům, či jejich prostřednictvím, je-li to zakázané národním či mezinárodním právem.</p><p>8.2 Kupující je povinen dodržovat veškeré povinnosti dle nařízení REACH, a neprodleně poskytnout IMCD informace, které by mohly být rozumně a pravidelně požadovány k zajíštění dodržování nařízení REACH ze strany IMCD. Kupující uhradí veškeré náklady a výdaje, jež IMCD vzniknou v souvislosti s povinnostmi vyplývajícími pro IMCD na základě REACH z důvodu zamýšleného užívání výrobků Kupujícím. Veškeré informace a údaje poskytnuté IMCD o látkách obsažených ve výrobcích jsou přísně důvěrné a Kupujícím mohou být zpřístupněny pouze, vyžaduje-li to REACH.</p><p>8.3 Aniž jsou dotčena ostatní ustanovení tohoto článku 8, Kupující jedná při plnění svých povinností z Dohody v souladu se všemi právními předpisy a nařízeními způsobem odpovídajícím etickému kodexu IMCD.

Minor variations in stated size, weight, number, colour and other product properties shall not be considered to be defects. Commercial practice shall determine whether variations are minor. </p><p>2.4   IMCD shall be entitled at all times, before starting or continuing its performance, to require security from the Purchaser for the fulfilment of any of its obligations under any Agreement. The security shall be provided in the manner stipulated by IMCD in its sole discretion.</p><p>2.5   If the Purchaser has not provided security within 14 days of a request to that effect, in the manner stipulated by IMCD, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 3   DELIVERIES</p><p>3.1   Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery of products shall be ex-works at such premises as IMCD may designate to the Purchaser from time to time (Incoterms EXW).</p><p>3.2   Delivery shall take place in accordance with the definitions of the latest version of the Incoterms. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Incoterms, the Incoterms shall prevail.</p><p>3.3   The risk attached to the products purchased will pass to the Purchaser at the time of delivery. The time of delivery is the time that the products purchased arrive at the place of delivery, even if the Purchaser does not accept the delivery. For delivery ex-works, the time of delivery is the time that IMCD notifies the Purchaser that the products purchased are ready for collection.</p><p>3.4   Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery period specified and agreed will not be a final deadline. The mere fact that IMCD exceeds the agreed delivery period shall not constitute a breach of contract, shall not result in default or any liability to the Purchaser and shall not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement or to any other remedy for breach of contract.</p><p>3.5   If a delivery period has not been expressly agreed upon, a reasonable delivery period shall apply.</p><p>3.6   IMCD shall have the right at all times to deliver in consignments, and shall always be entitled to invoice for such partial performances separately.</p><p>3.7   If the Purchaser does not accept delivery, or in the case of ex-works delivery does not collect the products delivered within seven days after delivery and/or in the manner stipulated by IMCD, the Purchaser shall be in default without notice of default being required, and IMCD shall in any case be entitled to invoice for and receive the agreed price. IMCD shall then also be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights under the law, to store the products at the Purchaser’s expense and risk, all costs arising therefrom, including but not limited to increases in duties, levies, premiums, taxes and charges, shall be payable by the Purchaser. </p><p>3.8   If a situation provided for in Article 3.7 arises, and, despite being given a reasonable time by IMCD, the Purchaser still fails later to take up the products or fails to do so in time and/or properly, IMCD shall without prejudice to its other rights under the law, these Terms and Conditions and/or the Agreement be released from all its obligations and be entitled to retain the purchase price (if paid) as compensation for the storage costs incurred and against any loss of value which the products have sustained since delivery.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 4   PRICES</p><p>4.1   Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, all prices shall be ex-works. All prices shall be exclusive of VAT, the costs of transporting and/or dispatching the products, other costs incurred in connection with delivery, government levies and/or taxes payable.</p><p>4.2   IMCD shall be entitled at all times to change its prices, on condition that prices already agreed may be changed only if the cost-determining factors on which the prices are based have changed since the Agreement was concluded and prior to delivery. Such price adjustments will not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement. Such cost-determining factors include without limitation raw material prices, labour costs, social security costs, taxes (including VAT and other government levies), import and export duties and exchange rates.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 5   TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND PACKAGING</p><p>5.1   Unless otherwise agreed, returnable packaging provided by IMCD shall remain the property of IMCD at all times and must be returned to IMCD in perfect condition after use.

Furthermore, the deposit shall not be returned if returnable packaging provided by IMCD is Article 5 returned after it has been used by the Purchaser for more than two years. Only if the returnable packaging concerns intermediate bulk containers, the Purchaser will be charged a reasonable rent from 30 days after delivery, in addition to the deposit. This rent shall be charged after the intermediate bulk containers have been returned. IMCD shall have the right to deduct rent from the deposit.</p><p>5.2   The loading or filling of transport equipment and/or packaging made available by the Purchaser shall take place at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. If IMCD should nonetheless be liable, the provisions of Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions shall then be fully applicable.</p><p>5.3   IMCD shall have the right to refuse to load equipment and/or fill packaging if it does not comply with the reasonable safety requirements set by IMCD from time to time. In that case, IMCD shall not be liable for any costs arising from a possible delay. Costs shall also be understood to include the costs referred to in Article 3.7.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 6   RETURNS, COMPLAINTS AND GUARANTEE</p><p>6.1.   Without prior written consent on its part, IMCD shall not be obliged to accept returns from the Purchaser.

Complaints must be made in writing within 14 days of the time of delivery, stating the reasons for the complaint and if possible accompanied by proof, failing which the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the quantity and quality of the products and shall lose any claim against IMCD in respect of defects in the products supplied, subject to the provisions of Article 7 regarding warranties.</p><p>6.4.   Complaints about products which have already been treated and/or processed in any way after delivery shall not be accepted.</p><p>6.5.   Submitting a complaint will not release the Purchaser from its payment obligations.</p><p>6.6.   If a complaint is submitted in time and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, and IMCD is reasonably of the opinion that the complaint is justified, IMCD shall be free to choose either to deliver what is lacking, or to redeliver the products found to be unsound free of charge, or to grant a discount on the price. By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its warranty obligation under Article 7 fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD.</p><p>6.7.   The guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products.</p><p>6.8.   Any claim under this Article 6 shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 7   WARRANTY</p><p>IMCD warrants to the Purchaser that the products sold to the Purchaser shall at the moment of delivery comply with the specifications as provided by IMCD to the Purchaser for such products.

This warranty will lapse if the Purchaser fails to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Invoking the warranty will not release the Purchaser from its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms and Conditions, in case of a breach of the warranty given to the Purchaser in terms of this Article 7, the Purchaser´s only remedy is a claim for specific performance by IMCD of its obligations under such warranty. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 8   LIABILITY</p><p>8.1.   IMCD will not be liable for any damage sustained by the Purchaser, irrespective of whether this damage is the result of failure by IMCD to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions (including the warranty obligation of Article 7), or of any act and/or omission by IMCD itself and/or by others acting on IMCD’s instructions, unless the Purchaser proves that the damage is the result of intentional or wilful recklessness by, exclusively any director or directors of IMCD.</p><p>8.2.   Unless otherwise provided by law, IMCD shall never be liable for (i) indirect loss of any kind including special or consequential loss, (ii) lost revenue or profits, or (iii) loss suffered by the Purchaser or by a third party as a result of IMCD, or a person for whom it is liable under the law, committing a non-material breach of the Agreement.</p><p>8.3.   IMCD shall not be liable for damage or loss, of whatever nature and in whatever form, which arises or is incurred after the products delivered by IMCD have been treated and/or processed.</p><p>8.4.   IMCD does not guarantee the completeness and accuracy of information received by IMCD from its own supplier and will not be liable for any damage – of whatever nature and in whatever form – incurred as a result of the incompleteness or inaccuracy of this information.</p><p>8.5.   The liability of IMCD shall at any event be limited at all times per event, with a series of connected events counting as one event, to the amount that is paid out under IMCD’s business liability insurance policy in the case concerned.</p><p>8.6.   The Purchaser must compensate IMCD for, and indemnify it against, all third-party claims, for whatever reason, in connection with compensation for any damage, costs, interest and/or losses which arise in connection with the products delivered by IMCD to the Purchaser, unless and insofar as the Purchaser demonstrates that the claim falls exclusively within IMCD&#39;s area of responsibility. </p><p>8.7.   The provisions of this Article shall also apply in favour of all legal or natural persons used by IMCD to perform the Agreement.</p><p>8.8.   Any claim for damages shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery.</p><p><br></p><p>Article 9   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</p><p>9.1   The Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws and conventions including but not limited to laws relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption such as chapter 10 in the Swedish Penal Code (1962:700), and laws relating to export control and customs regulations such as (i) the rules on embargoed countries, (ii) the restrictions on the sale of products to restricted or denied customers, and (iii) the regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items.

Minor variations in stated size, weight, number, color and the suchlike shall not be considered to be defects. Commercial practice shall determine whether variations are minor. </p><p>艾敏斯帝出示的或提供的样品和模型仅作为示范，产品并不必须符合这些样品和模型。不应将对规定的尺寸、重量、数量、颜色和类似项目的细微变动视为缺陷。应根据行业惯例确定变动是否细微。 </p><p>2.4 IMCD shall be entitled at all times, before starting or continuing its performance, to require security from the Purchaser for the fulfillment of any of its obligations under any Agreement. The security shall be provided in the manner stipulated by IMCD. </p><p>在开始或继续履行之前，艾敏斯帝应有权在所有时候要求买方对其履行在任何协议中的义务提供担保。买方应以艾敏斯帝规定的方式提供担保。 </p><p>2.5 If the Purchaser has not provided security within 14 days of a request to that effect, in the manner stipulated by IMCD, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required. </p><p>如果买方未能在艾敏斯帝提出要求后 14 天内以艾敏斯帝规定的方式提供担保，买方应向艾敏斯帝付清其拖欠的所有款项，而无须艾敏斯帝提前发出买方违约的通知。 </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Article 3 DELIVERIES </p><p>第 3 条交货 </p><p>3.1 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery period specified and agreed will not be a final deadline. The mere fact that IMCD exceeds the agreed delivery period shall not constitute a breach of contract, shall not result in default or any liability to the Purchaser and shall not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement. </p><p>除了另有明确书面约定外，约定的和同意的交货期间不是最终截止期限。如果仅有艾敏斯帝超过了同意的交货期间的事实，这不应构成违反合同，不应导致对买方违约、或对买方承担任何责任，也不应使得买方有权解除协议。 </p><p>3.   2 If a delivery period has not been expressly agreed upon, a reasonable delivery period shall apply. 如果没有明确约定交货期间，合理的交货期间应适用。 </p><p>3.3   IMCD shall have the right at all times to deliver in consignments, and shall always be entitled to invoice for such partial performances separately. </p><p>艾敏斯帝应有权在所有时候交付货物，并应总是有权对部分履行另外开具发票。 </p><p>3.4   If the Purchaser does not accept delivery, or does not collect the products delivered within seven days after delivery and/or in the manner stipulated by IMCD, the Purchaser shall be in default without notice of default being required, and IMCD shall in any case be entitled to invoice for the agreed price. IMCD shall then also be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights under the law, </p><p>to store the products at the Purchaser’s expense and risk, all costs arising therefrom, including increases in duties, levies, premiums and the suchlike, shall be payable by the Purchaser. 如果买方未接受交货，买方未在交货后七天内和/或以艾敏斯帝规定的方式接受交付的产品，买方应构成违约，而无须艾敏斯帝发出违约通知，并且在任何情况下，艾敏斯帝应有权按照约定的价格开具发票。在不影响根据法律可获得的其他权利的情况下，艾敏斯帝还应有权保管产品，并由买方承担由此产生的费用和风险，由此产生的所有成本，包括增加的关税、赋税、保险费和类似费用，都应由买方支付。 </p><p>3.5   If a situation provided for in Article 3.7 arises, and, despite being given a reasonable time by IMCD, the Purchaser still fails later to take up the products or fails to do so in time and/or properly, IMCD shall be released from all its obligations. In that case, IMCD may offset the refund of the purchase price (if paid) against the storage costs incurred and against any loss of value which the products have sustained since delivery. </p><p>如果出现了第 3.7 条中规定的情形，并且尽管艾敏斯帝给予了合理的时间，买方仍未能在以后接受产品，或未能及时地和/或适当地接受产品，应免除艾敏斯帝的所有义务。在这种情况下，艾敏斯帝可以用退还的采购价格（如已支付）抵销从交货起发生的保管费用以及产品已遭受的任何价值损失。 </p><p><br></p><p>Article 4 PRICES </p><p>第 4 条价格 </p><p>4.1 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, all prices shall be ex-works.

Such price adjustments will not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement. Such cost-determining factors include without limitation raw material prices, labor costs, social security costs, taxes (including VAT and other government levies), import and export duties and exchange rates. </p><p>艾敏斯帝应有权在所有时候变更价格，即如果在协议签订后，并在交货前，作为价格基础的成本决定因素发生了变动，艾敏斯帝可以变更已约定的价格。买方无权因该价格调整解除协议。这些价格决定因素包括但不限于原材料价格、劳动力成本、社会保障费用、税（包括增值税和其他政府征税）、进出口关税和汇率。 </p><p><br></p><p>Article 5 TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND PACKAGING 第 5 条运输设备和包装 </p><p>5.1 Unless otherwise agreed, returnable packaging provided by IMCD shall remain the property of IMCD at all times and must be returned to IMCD in perfect condition after use. If the returnable packaging is not returned in perfect condition, IMCD shall no longer be obliged to take back the returnable packaging, and the deposit charged shall not be returned either. Furthermore, the deposit shall not be returned if returnable packaging provided by IMCD is returned after it has been used by the Purchaser for more than two years. Only if the returnable packaging concerns intermediate bulk containers, the Purchaser will be charged a reasonable rent from 30 days after delivery, in addition to the deposit. This rent shall be charged after the intermediate bulk containers have been returned. IMCD shall have the right to deduct rent from the deposit. </p><p>除了另有约定外，艾敏斯帝提供的可回收包装应在所有时候仍是艾敏斯帝的财产，并在使用后必须完好地返还给艾敏斯帝。如果买方未能完好地返还可回收包装，艾敏斯帝应不再有义务收回可回收包装，并且也不会退还收取的保证金。而且，如果买方在使用了艾敏斯帝提供的可回收包装超过两年后，将它们返还给艾敏斯帝，艾敏斯帝不应退还保证金。仅如果可回收包装与中型散货容器有关，除了保证金外，从交货后 30 天起，艾敏斯帝会向买方收取合理的租金。艾敏斯帝应在买方返还中型散货容器后收取租金，并有权从保证金中扣除租金。 </p><p>5.2 The loading or filling of transport equipment and/or packaging made available by the Purchaser shall take place at the </p><p><br></p><p>Purchaser’s expense and risk. If IMCD should nonetheless be liable, the provisions of Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions shall then be fully applicable. </p><p>买方应装载或填装提供给它的运输设备和/或包装，并自行承担费用和风险。但是，如果艾敏斯帝应负责，本条款与条件第 8 条的规定应完全适用。 </p><p>5.3 IMCD shall have the right to refuse to load equipment and/or fill packaging if it does not fulfil reasonable safety requirements set by IMCD. In that case, IMCD shall not be liable for any costs arising from a possible delay. Costs shall also be understood to include the costs referred to in Article 3.7. </p><p>如果运输设备或包装不符合艾敏斯帝设定的合理安全要求，艾敏斯帝有权拒绝装载运输设备或填装包装。在这种情况下，艾敏斯帝不应对可能延误造成的任何成本承担责任。应理解该成本包括第 3.7 条中提到的成本。 </p><p><br></p><p>Article 6 RETURNS, COMPLAINTS AND GUARANTEE </p><p>第 6 条退货、投诉和保证 </p><p>6.1. Without prior written consent on its part, IMCD shall not be obliged to accept returns from the Purchaser. If products are returned without the prior written consent of IMCD, their dispatch and storage after their return shall be at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. 未经艾敏斯帝提前书面同意，艾敏斯帝不应有义务从买方接受退货。如果未经艾敏斯帝提前书面同意，买方退还了产品，在退还产品后发生的运输和保管费用和风险应由买方承担。 </p><p>6.2. The risk in returned products shall continue to be borne by the Purchaser until IMCD has accepted the return and the returned products in writing, to which acceptance IMCD may attach conditions. </p><p>在艾敏斯帝已书面接受了退货和退还的产品之前，买方应继续承担退还的产品的风险，并且艾敏斯帝可对接受退还的产品附加条件。 </p><p>6.3. The Purchaser shall itself be responsible for checking, or having someone check, the conformity of products during their delivery. Complaints must be made in writing within 14 days of the time of delivery, stating the reasons for the complaint and if possible accompanied by proof, failing which the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the quantity and quality of the products and shall lose any claim against IMCD in respect of defects in the products supplied, subject to the provisions of Article 7 regarding warranties. </p><p>买方应对在产品交货期间检验或委托他人检验产品的合格性自行承担责任。买方必须在交货后 14 天内提出投诉，说明投诉原因，并且如果可能，附上证据，如果买方未能这样做，应视为买方已接受了产品的数量和质量，并失去了根据第 7 条中与保证有关的规定对供应的产品中存在的缺陷向艾敏斯帝提出索赔的权利。 </p><p>6.4. Complaints about products which have already been treated and/or processed in any way after delivery shall not be accepted. 艾敏斯帝不应受理在交货后以任何方式处理的和/或进行的产品投诉。 </p><p>6.5. Submitting a complaint will not release the Purchaser from its payment obligations. 提出投诉不应免除买方的付款义务。 </p><p>6.6. If a complaint is submitted in time and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, and IMCD is reasonably of the opinion that the complaint is justified, IMCD shall be free to choose either to deliver what is lacking, or to redeliver the products found to be unsound free of charge, or to grant a discount on the price. By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its guarantee obligation fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD. </p><p>如果买方根据本条款与条件及时提出了投诉，并且按照艾敏斯帝的合理意见，投诉是有正当理由的，艾敏斯帝应自由选择免费交付缺失的产品、或重新交付被发现有缺陷的产品、或减价。通过实施规定的一种方式，艾敏斯帝应已充分履行了它的保证义务，并不应有义务支付任何其他赔偿。被更换的产品应是艾敏斯帝的财产。 </p><p>6.7. The guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products. </p><p>第三方交付的产品的保证期间不得超过这些产品的制造商或进口商向艾敏斯帝提供的保证期间。 </p><p><br></p><p>6.8.

IMCD does not make any express or implied warranty as to the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of the products. This warranty will lapse if the Purchaser fails to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Invoking the warranty will not release the Purchaser from its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. In case of a breach of the warranty, the Purchaser&#39;s only remedy is a claim for performance of the Agreement by IMCD. </p><p>艾敏斯帝保证，在交货时，它向买方出售的产品符合艾敏斯帝向买方提供的产品规范。艾敏斯帝没有对产品的适销性或适于特定目的做出任何明示的或默示的保证。如果买方未能履行它在协议和/或本条款与条件中的义务，本保证失效。质疑保证不会免除买方在协议和/或本条款与条件中的义务。如果艾敏斯帝违反了保证，买方的唯一救济是要求艾敏斯帝履行协议。 </p><p><br></p><p>Article 8 LIABILITY </p><p>第 8 条责任 </p><p>8.1. IMCD will not be liable for any damage sustained by the Purchaser, irrespective of whether this damage is the result of failure by IMCD to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions (including the warranty obligation of Article 7), or of any act and/or omission by IMCD itself and/or by others acting on IMCD’s instructions, unless the Purchaser proves that the damage is the result of intentional or wilful recklessness by, exclusively, IMCD’s management. </p><p>艾敏斯帝不会对买方遭受的任何损害承担责任，而不管该损害是由于艾敏斯帝未能履行它在协议和/或本条款与条件（包括第 7 条的保证义务）中的义务、或艾敏斯帝本身和/或听从艾敏斯帝指示的其他人的任何行为和/或疏忽造成的，除非买方证明该损害是仅由于艾敏斯帝管理层的故意或因重大过失造成的。 </p><p>8.2. IMCD shall never be liable for indirect loss of any kind including consequential loss and lost profits, and non-material loss suffered by the Purchaser or by a third party as a result of IMCD, or a person for whom it is liable under the law, failing in the performance of the Agreement. </p><p>艾敏斯帝不应对任何种类的间接损失承担责任，包括由于艾敏斯帝或根据法律对艾敏斯帝承担责任的人未能履行协议而使得买方或第三方遭受的结果性损失、利润损失和非实质损失。 </p><p>8.3. IMCD shall not be liable for damage or loss, of whatever nature and in whatever form, which arises or is incured after the products delivered by IMCD have been treated and/or processed. </p><p>艾敏斯帝不应对在处理和/或加工它交付的产品后出现的、任何性质和任何形式的损害或者损失承担责任。 </p><p>8.4. IMCD does not guarantee the completeness and accuracy of information received by IMCD from its own supplier and will not be liable for any damage - of whatever nature and in whatever form - incurred as a result of the incompleteness or inaccuracy of this information. </p><p>艾敏斯帝不会对其从自己的供应商收到的信息的完整性和准确性承担责任，并且也不会由于该信息的不完整或不准确造成的、任何性质和任何形式的损害承担责任。 </p><p>8.5. The liability of IMCD shall at any event be limited at all times per event, with a series of connected events counting as one event, to the amount that is paid out under IMCD’s business liability insurance policy in the case concerned. </p><p>在任何情况下，艾敏斯帝对每起事件（一系列相关的事件算作一起事件）的责任在所有时候应限于根据有关的艾敏斯帝商业责任保险单赔偿的保险金额。 </p><p>8.6. The Purchaser must compensate IMCD for, and indemnify it against, all third-party claims, for whatever reason, in connection </p><p><br></p><p>with compensation for any damage, costs, interest and/or losses which arise in connection with the products delivered by IMCD to the Purchaser, unless and insofar as the Purchaser demonstrates that the claim falls exclusively within IMCD&#39;s area of responsibility. </p><p>对由于任何原因，艾敏斯帝向买方交付的产品造成的、与任何损害、成本、利息和/或损失有关的所有第三方索赔，买方都应对艾敏斯帝予以赔偿和补偿，除非、并在一定范围内买方证明该索赔仅在艾敏斯帝的责任范围内。 </p><p>8.7.

Minor variations in stated size, weight, number, colour and suchlike shall not be considered to be defects. Commercial practice shall determine whether variations are minor. </p><p>2.4 IMCD shall be entitled at all times, before starting or continuing its performance, to require security from the Purchaser for the fulfilment of any of its obligations under any Agreement. The security shall be provided in the manner stipulated by IMCD. </p><p>2.5   If the Purchaser has not provided security within 14 days of a request to that effect, in the manner stipulated by IMCD, all amounts owed by the Purchaser to IMCD shall be due and payable in full and immediately, without prior notice of default being required. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 3      DELIVERIES </p><p>3.1 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery shall be ex-works (Incoterms EXW). </p><p>3.2 Delivery shall take place in accordance with the definitions of the latest version of the Incoterms. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Incoterms, the Incoterms shall prevail. </p><p>3.3 The risk attached to the products purchased will pass to the Purchaser at the time of delivery. The time of delivery is the time that the products purchased arrive at the place of delivery, even if the Purchaser does not accept the delivery. For delivery exworks, the time of delivery is the time that IMCD notifies the Purchaser that the products purchased are ready for collection. </p><p>3.4 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, the delivery period specified and agreed will not be a final deadline. The mere fact that IMCD exceeds the agreed delivery period shall not constitute a breach of contract, shall not result in default or any liability to the Purchaser and shall not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement. </p><p>3.5 If a delivery period has not been expressly agreed upon, a reasonable delivery period shall apply. </p><p>3.6 IMCD shall have the right at all times to deliver in consignments, and shall always be entitled to invoice for such partial performances separately. </p><p>3.7 If the Purchaser does not accept delivery, or in the case of ex-works delivery, does not collect the products delivered within seven days after delivery and/or in the manner stipulated by IMCD, the Purchaser shall be in default without notice of default being required, and IMCD shall in any case be entitled to invoice for the agreed price.

In that case, IMCD may offset the refund of the purchase price (if paid) against the storage costs incurred and against any loss of value which the products have sustained since delivery. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 4      PRICES </p><p>4.1 Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, all prices shall be ex-works. All prices shall be exclusive of VAT, the costs of transporting and/or dispatching the products, other costs incurred in connection with delivery, government levies and/or taxes payable. </p><p>4.2   IMCD shall be entitled at all times to change its prices, on condition that prices already agreed may be changed only if the cost-determining factors on which the prices are based have changed since the Agreement was concluded and prior to delivery. Such price adjustments will not entitle the Purchaser to terminate the Agreement. Such cost-determining factors include without limitation raw material prices, labour costs, social security costs, taxes (including VAT and other government levies), import and export duties and exchange rates. </p><p><br></p><p>   Article 5      TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND PACKAGING </p><p>5.1 Unless otherwise agreed, returnable packaging provided by IMCD shall remain the property of IMCD at all times and must be returned to IMCD in perfect condition after use. If the returnable packaging is not returned in perfect condition, IMCD shall no longer be obliged to take back the returnable packaging, and the deposit charged shall not be returned either. Furthermore, the deposit shall not be returned if returnable packaging provided by IMCD is returned after it has been used by the Purchaser for more than two years. Only if the returnable packaging concerns intermediate bulk containers, the Purchaser will be charged a reasonable rent from 30 days after delivery, in addition to the deposit. This rent shall be charged after the intermediate bulk containers have been returned. IMCD shall have the right to deduct rent from the deposit. </p><p>5.2 The loading or filling of transport equipment and/or packaging made available by the Purchaser shall take place at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. If IMCD should nonetheless be liable, the provisions of Article 8 of these Terms and Conditions shall then be fully applicable. </p><p>5.3 IMCD shall have the right to refuse to load equipment and/or fill packaging if it does not fulfil reasonable safety requirements set by IMCD. In that case, IMCD shall not be liable for any costs arising from a possible delay. Costs shall also be understood to include the costs referred to in Article 3.7. </p><p><br></p><p>   Article 6      RETURNS, COMPLAINTS AND GUARANTEE </p><p>6.1. Without prior written consent on its part, IMCD shall not be obliged to accept returns from the Purchaser.

The risk in returned products shall continue to be borne by the Purchaser until IMCD has accepted the return in writing and received the returned products, to which acceptance IMCD may attach conditions. </p><p>6.3. The Purchaser shall itself be responsible for checking, or having someone check, the conformity of products during their delivery. Complaints must be made in writing within 14 days of the time of delivery, stating the reasons for the complaint and if possible accompanied by proof, failing which the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the quantity and quality of the products and shall lose any claim against IMCD in respect of defects in the products supplied, subject to the provisions of Article 7 regarding warranties. </p><p>6.4. Complaints about products which have already been treated and/or processed in any way after delivery shall not be accepted. </p><p>   6.5.   Submitting a complaint will not release the Purchaser from its payment obligations. </p><p>6.6. If a complaint is submitted in time and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, and IMCD is reasonably of the opinion that the complaint is justified, IMCD shall be free to choose either to deliver what is lacking, or to redeliver the products found to be unsound free of charge, or to grant a discount on the price. By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its guarantee obligation fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD. </p><p>6.7. The guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products. </p><p>6.8.   Any claim under this Article 6 shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery. </p><p><br></p><p>   Article 7      WARRANTY </p><p>IMCD warrants that the products sold to the Purchaser shall at the moment of delivery comply with the specifications as provided by IMCD to the Purchaser for such products. IMCD does not make any express or implied warranty as to the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of the products. This warranty will lapse if the Purchaser fails to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Invoking the warranty will not release the Purchaser from its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. In case of a breach of the warranty, the Purchaser&#39;s only remedy is a claim for performance of the Agreement by IMCD. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 8   LIABILITY </p><p>8.1. IMCD will not be liable for any damage sustained by the Purchaser, irrespective of whether this damage is the result of failure by IMCD to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions (including the warranty obligation of </p><p>Article 7), or of any act and/or omission by IMCD itself and/or by others acting on </p><p>IMCD’s instructions, unless the Purchaser proves that the damage is the result of intentional or wilful recklessness by, exclusively, IMCD’s management. </p><p>8.2.

IMCD does not guarantee the completeness and accuracy of information received by IMCD from its own supplier and will not be liable for any damage – of whatever nature and in whatever form – incurred as a result of the incompleteness or inaccuracy of this information. </p><p>8.5. The liability of IMCD shall at any event be limited at all times per event, with a series of connected events counting as one event, to the amount that is paid out under </p><p>IMCD’s business liability insurance policy in the case concerned. </p><p>8.6. The Purchaser must compensate IMCD for, and indemnify it against, all third-party claims, for whatever reason, in connection with compensation for any damage, costs, interest and/or losses which arise in connection with the products delivered by IMCD to the Purchaser, unless and insofar as the Purchaser demonstrates that the claim falls exclusively within IMCD&#39;s area of responsibility. </p><p>8.7. The provisions of this Article shall also apply in favour of all legal or natural persons used by IMCD to perform the Agreement. </p><p>   8.8.   Any claim for damages shall in any case lapse three months after the time of delivery. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 9    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS </p><p>9.1 The Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws including but not limited to laws relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption such as the 2010 Bribery Act of the United Kingdom, and laws relating to export control and customs regulations such as (i) the rules on embargoed countries, (ii) the restrictions on the sale of products to restricted or denied customers, and (iii) the regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items.

Each such amendment or modification shall be binding upon Buyer with respect to all purchases occurring after the date of such modification.</p><p><br></p><p>2.   PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. </p><p>Seller may adjust the prices of Deliverables on undelivered Deliverables or orders at any time. Buyer may cancel or suspend any such orders subject to any price increase immediately upon notice of such price increase, unless such price increase relates to an increase in the cost of shipping or insurance prior to the shipping date as contemplated by Section 7 hereof, in which case the Buyer may not cancel or suspend the order for the relevant Deliverables and shall pay such increased price. Any order so suspended that is not renewed within 30 days shall be deemed cancelled. In no event shall Seller have any obligation or liability to Buyer on account of any such cancellations or suspensions.</p><p><br></p><p>3.   PAYMENT. </p><p>Payment terms are net 30 days from date of invoice.

These Obligations within the exclusion of warranty according to art. 1491 ICC, as hereby provided, have been taken into account for the quotation and pricing of each IMCD products. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 2 - OFFERS AND AGREEMENTS </p><p>2.1 Any offer, quotation and price offered by IMCD is not binding and shall be interpreted as an invitation to the Buyer to make an offer for a binding purchase. The </p><p> Agreement is concluded when Purchaser receives written confirmation by IMCD of its initial order (offer) according to art. 1326 Italian Civil Code (“ICC”). In case that IMCD’s confirmation differs from the Purchaser’s offer, such acceptance constitutes a new non-binding offer by IMCD. Samples and models shown or provided shall serve as indications only, without the products having to comply with those samples and models (art. 1522 ICC expressly excluded). Minor variations, including in stated size, weight, number and colour shall not be considered as defects. Normal commercial practice shall determine whether variations shall be considered as minor. </p><p>2.2 IMCD shall be entitled to require security from the Purchaser for the fulfilment of any of Purchaser’s Obligations under any Agreement either before starting its own performance or, according to art. 1461 ICC, in the event the economic conditions of the Purchaser – in the discretion of IMCD - have deteriorated and /or jeopardize the fulfilment of its Obligations and duties.

In the event of a conflict between these CGVs and the Incoterms, the Incoterms shall prevail. </p><p>3.3 The risk attached to the purchased products will pass to the Purchaser at the time of delivery. The time of delivery is the time when IMCD notifies the Purchaser that the purchased products are ready for collection, even if the Purchaser does not accept the delivery. </p><p>3.4 The delivery term specified and agreed shall not be a final and essential deadline for IMCD and has a descriptive purpose as an indication of readiness only. The mere fact that IMCD is in delay and exceeds the agreed delivery period, shall not constitute a breach of contract and IMCD shall not be in default or liable to the Purchaser as a result thereof. The Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate the Agreement or to any other remedy by law. </p><p>3.5 If a delivery period has not been expressly agreed upon, a reasonable delivery period shall apply. </p><p>3.6 IMCD shall have the right at all times to deliver in consignments and shall always be entitled to invoice for such partial performances separately. </p><p>3.7 If the Purchaser does not accept delivery, or in the case of ex-works delivery does not timely collect the products delivered (within seven days after delivery and/or in the manner stipulated by IMCD), the Purchaser shall be in default without notice of default being required, and IMCD shall in any case be entitled to invoice for the agreed price. IMCD shall then also be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights under the law, to store the products at the Purchaser’s expense and risk, and all costs arising therefrom, including but not limited to supply back and logistic costs, increases in duties, levies, premiums and the suchlike, shall be payable by the </p><p>      Purchaser. </p><p>3.8 In addition, if a situation provided for in Article 3.7 arises, and, despite being given a reasonable time by IMCD, the Purchaser still fails later to take up the products or fails to do so in time and/or properly (which is, in any case, upon the 90th day after the original delivery date), IMCD shall be released from all its obligations and, in addition, is entitled to sell the products to third parties, charging on the Purchaser all costs arising from the delay as well as the constituent sale to a third party, including but not limited to supply back and logistic costs, storage, increases in duties, levies, premiums, charges and loss of value which the products have sustained since delivery. </p><p>3.9 For the avoidance of doubt, in a situation of a constituent sale of the products as provided for in Article 3.8, according to art. 1515 ICC, IMCD is also entitled – as liquidated damages and save further damages - either to (i) the difference between the price that was agreed with the Purchaser and the net proceeds of the constituent sale or (ii) to compensation of the value of the eventual leftover products remaining after the constituent sale. </p><p>3.10 The situations provided for in this Article 3.7 to 3.9 do not require a prior notice of default and do not prejudice any other IMCD’s rights under the law. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 4 - PRICES </p><p>4.1 All prices are EXW and determined taking into account the Purchaser’s Obligations.

If the returnable packaging is not returned in perfect condition, IMCD shall no longer be obliged to take back the returnable packaging, and any deposit that may have been charged to the Purchaser in respect of such returnable packaging, shall not be returned either. Furthermore, such deposit shall not be returned if the returnable packaging provided by IMCD is returned after it has been used by the Purchaser for more than 2 (two) years. If the returnable packaging consists out of intermediate bulk containers, the Purchaser will be charged a reasonable rent starting from the 30th days upon the day of the delivery, in addition to the deposit. This rent shall be charged after the intermediate bulk containers have been returned. IMCD shall have the right to set off any right for the payment of rent against a Purchaser’s right for return of the deposit. </p><p>5.2 The loading or filling of transport equipment and/or packaging made available by the Purchaser shall take place at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. </p><p>5.3 IMCD shall have the right to refuse to load Purchaser’s equipment and/or fill packaging if the equipment / packaging provided by the Purchaser does not comply with the safety requirements applied by IMCD. In that case, IMCD shall not be liable for any costs arising from any related delay and Article 3.7 shall apply. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 6 – RETURNS AND COMPLAINTS </p><p>6.1 IMCD does not accept returns from the Purchaser, without IMCD’s prior written consent. If products are returned without the prior written consent of IMCD, their transportation, dispatch and storage shall be at the Purchaser’s expense and risk. </p><p>6.2 The risk in returned products shall continue to be borne by the Purchaser until IMCD has expressly accepted the returned products in writing, to which acceptance IMCD may attach conditions. </p><p>6.3 As an essential part of any Agreement and a basic principle of these CGVs, the Purchaser acknowledges and expressly accepts to be obliged to check the conformity of any and all products during their delivery, pointing out any visible non-conformity - including but not limited to - quantity, quality, documentation and labeling on the delivery note which shall be signed by the carrier. Lacking of such (signed) notice, the products shall be deemed definitively accepted free of such non-conformity and the Purchaser cannot claim any subsequent non-conformity of the delivered products, that should have been discovered with due care during delivery. </p><p>6.4 Moreover the Purchaser acknowledges to have a further essential and material contractual duty to - as soon as possible and in any event prior to any use and/or reselling, and at least not later that 14 (fourteen) days after delivery - test and effectively evaluate, among others, whether: (i) the products (including samples and models) meet the specifications, as provided by IMCD; (ii) the products and/or any related technical support and information, as provided by IMCD, do not have any related hidden non-conformity. The Purchaser’s Obligation to inspect, test and evaluate the delivered products as described herein shall, among others, consist out of an application-specific analysis and shall, at least, include testing to determine compliance from a technical as well as health, safety, and environmental standpoint. The Purchaser in breach of these obligations cannot claim any consequent non-conformity and/or defects, also hidden, of the delivered products. </p><p>6.5 Any notice of complain must be served by the Purchaser to IMCD in writing within 14 (fourteen) days from the day of delivery, stating the reasons for the claimed non-conformity with documentary evidence of the fulfillment by the Purchaser of its Obligations as described in Article 6.4 above. Failing such written communication by the Purchaser, the delivered products shall be deemed to have been definitively accepted, analogously to art. 1665 ICC. </p><p>6.6 Submitting a complaint does not release the Purchaser from its payment obligations in accordance with the agreed due dates. </p><p>6.7 The Parties confirm and acknowledge that the price of the delivered products has been determined even taking into consideration the specific and essential </p><p>      Purchaser’s Obligations and the terms and conditions as described in this Article 6. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 7 - WARRANTY </p><p>7.1 Save the limitation provided in these CGVs, IMCD only warrants that the delivered products shall, at the time of delivery, comply with the specifications as expressly provided by IMCD in connection to any specific product sold. IMCD does not make any express or implied warranty as to the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of the products. </p><p>7.2 If a complaint is submitted on time and in accordance with these CGVs, and IMCD is reasonably of the opinion that the complaint is justified, IMCD shall be free to choose either to (a) free of charge for the Purchaser, deliver what is lacking or to re-deliver the products that was qualified defective, or (b) grant a discount on the price. by performing one of these remedies, IMCD shall have discharged its warranty obligation fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. Replaced products shall become the property of IMCD and are to be returned in accordance with the procedure established in Article 6 herein. The solution described herein also applies in case of an established and ascertained decision (by the competent Court) of a breach of any warranty since the only remedy for the Purchaser is to claim for (re)performance of the Agreement. Any other remedy and/or damages is hereby expressly excluded. </p><p>7.3 The Purchaser acknowledges and expressly accepts that IMCD’s warranty on delivered products by third parties shall never exceed or extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by its supplier of those products. More over IMCD does not make any express or implied warranty on the circumstance that the products (purchased from third parties / suppliers) do not violate any intellectual property right. </p><p>7.4 The Parties confirm and acknowledge that the price of the delivered products has been determined taking into consideration these terms and conditions and limitation on warranty. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 8 – IMCD’S Obligation </p><p>8.1 IMCD will not be liable for any damage sustained by the Purchaser, irrespective of whether this damage is the result of failure by IMCD to fulfil its obligations under    the Agreement and/or these CGVs or of any act and/or omission by IMCD itself and/or by others acting on IMCD’s instructions, unless the Purchaser proves that the    damage is the result of intentional or willful misconduct ascribable exclusively by IMCD. the IMCD’s obligation in any event is limited to the value of the delivered    defective products and consists in their substitution or the grant of a discount to Purchaser. By performing one of these remedies, IMCD shall have discharged any    related obligation fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. </p><p>8.2 IMCD shall never be liable for indirect loss of any kind (including consequential loss, lossed profits and/or non-material loss) suffered by the Purchaser or by a third    party as a result of IMCD and/or any of its partners failure to perform under the Agreement. </p><p>8.3 IMCD shall not be liable for damages, of whatever nature and in whatever form, which arise after the delivered products have been used, treated, processed and/or sold on by Purchaser. </p><p>8.4 The Purchaser shall hold IMCD harmless from and compensate IMCD for all and any third-party claims for whatever reason linked to the delivered products, unless    and insofar as the Purchaser proves that such claim falls exclusively within IMCD&#39;s area of responsibility. </p><p><br></p><p>Article 9 - COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS </p><p>9.1 The Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws including but not limited to laws and conventions relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption such as the Italian D.Lgs 231/2001, and laws relating to export control and customs regulations such as (i) the rules on embargoed countries, (ii) the restrictions on the sale of products to restricted or denied customers, and (iii) the regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items.

In the case of delivery &quot;ex works&quot;, the time of delivery is the time at which IMCD informs the Buyer that the purchased products are ready for collection.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">3.4.	Unless a delivery period has been expressly agreed, a reasonable delivery period shall apply.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">3.5.	Delivery times/deadlines for deliveries and services (delivery periods) promised by IMCD are always only approximate, unless a fixed delivery period has been expressly promised or agreed.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">3.6.	IMCD is entitled at any time to carry out partial deliveries and to invoice such partial services with a separate invoice.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">3.7.	If the Buyer does not accept the delivery within seven days or in case of an &quot;ex works&quot; delivery does not collect it as determined by IMCD, IMCD is entitled to issue an invoice for the agreed price in any case. The Buyer is obliged to pay the purchase price. Without prejudice to other statutory rights, IMCD shall be entitled to store the Products at the Buyer&#39;s expense and risk and all resulting costs, including taxes, levies, surcharges or the like, shall be borne by the Buyer.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">3.8.	IMCD shall be released from the obligation to deliver if the upstream supplier does not deliver at the contract price, incorrectly, not on time or not at all from a congruent covering transaction that took place before or immediately after conclusion of the contract through no fault of IMCD and IMCD informs the Buyer of this circumstance immediately. In this case, IMCD undertakes to immediately reimburse any purchase price already paid. In the case of framework agreements or successive delivery agreements, IMCD shall also be entitled to this right of exemption from performance for partial deliveries, without this affecting the performance claim for the order remaining without regard to the respective partial delivery.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 4	PRICES</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">4.1.	Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, all prices are &quot;ex works&quot; (Incoterm EXW). All prices are exclusive of turnover tax, costs of transport and/or dispatch, other costs incurred in connection with the delivery and any government fees and/or taxes payable thereon. Value added tax, if any, will be charged separately.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">4.2.	IMCD is entitled to change its prices at any time, whereby already agreed prices may only be changed if there has been a change in cost-determining factors since the conclusion of the agreement and before delivery. Such price adjustments do not entitle the Buyer to dissolve the contract. Cost-determining factors are in particular raw material prices, labour costs, social security costs, taxes (including turnover tax and other government levies), import and export duties and changes in the exchange rate.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 5	TRANSPORTATION AND PACKAGING</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">5.1.	Unless otherwise agreed, reusable packaging always remains the property of IMCD and must be returned to IMCD after use in proper condition. If the packaging is not returned in proper condition, IMCD is no longer obliged to take back the returnable packaging and return the deposit. Furthermore, the deposit will not be refunded if the returnable packaging provided by IMCD is returned after the Buyer has used it for more than two years. However, if the reusable packaging is large packaging (IBC), a reasonable rent will be charged to the Buyer in addition to the deposit, starting 30 days after delivery. This rent will be invoiced after the IBCs have been returned. IMCD is entitled to retain the rent from the deposit.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">5.2.	Loading or filling of means of transport and/or packaging provided by the Buyer shall be at the expense and risk of the Buyer. If liability nevertheless arises for IMCD, the provisions of Article 8 of these General Conditions of Sale and Delivery shall apply in full.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">5.3.	IMCD is entitled to refuse to load means of transport and/or fill packaging if these do not meet the agreed safety requirements of IMCD. In this case, IMCD is not liable for any costs resulting from a possible delay.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 6	RETURNS, COMPLAINTS</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">6.1.	Without prior written consent, IMCD is not obliged to accept returns from the Buyer, as long as no case according to Article 7 of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Delivery exists. If products are returned to IMCD without prior written consent, shipment and storage after return shall be at the expense and risk of the Buyer.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">6.2.	The risk in connection with returned products remains with the Buyer until IMCD has declared in writing that it accepts the return and the returned products, whereby IMCD may attach conditions to this acceptance.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">6.3.	As an essential part of any Contract and a basic principle of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Delivery, the Buyer acknowledges and expressly accepts to be obliged to check the conformity of the products during their delivery, pointing out any visible non-conformity - including but not limited to - quantity, quality, documentation and labeling on the delivery note which shall be signed by the carrier. Lacking of such (signed) notice, the products shall be deemed definitively accepted free of such non-conformity and the Buyer cannot claim any subsequent non-conformity of the delivered products, that should have been discovered with due care during delivery.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">6.4.	Moreover the Buyer acknowledges to have a further essential and material contractual duty to - immediately (i.e. without undue delay) and in any event prior to any use and/or reselling - test and effectively evaluate, among others, whether: (i) the products (including samples and models) meet the specifications, as provided by IMCD; (ii) the products and/or any related technical support and information, as provided by IMCD, are suitable for Buyer’s intended uses and applications. The Buyer’s obligation to inspect, test and evaluate the delivered products as described herein shall, among others, consist out of an application-specific analysis and shall, at least, include testing to determine suitability from a technical as well as health, safety, and environmental standpoint. The Buyer in breach of these obligations cannot claim any consequent non-conformity and/or defects of the delivered products. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">6.5.	The Buyer is obliged to notify IMCD of any discovered defect immediately in writing with a description of the defect. Immediateness means that defects are notified at the latest within seven (7) working days after delivery or – in the case of a defect which was not recognisable during the inspection – at the latest within three (3) working days after discovery of the defect. The Buyer in breach of these obligations cannot claim any consequent non-conformity and/or defects of the delivered products.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 7	WARRANTY</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">7.1.	The warranty or in case applicable a guarantee on products delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the warranty or guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those products. IMCD warrants that the products sold to the Buyer shall at the moment of delivery comply with the specifications as provided by IMCD to the Buyer for such products. IMCD does not make any express or implied warranty as to the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of the products. IMCD therefore is only responsible for defects which impair the usability of the products to the extent that these defects are due to defective materials or workmanship. Obvious defects and shortages have to be notified immediately in writing to IMCD, hidden defects within 10 working days from discovery, otherwise the claim for warranty forfeits. If a complaint is submitted in time and in accordance with these General Terms and Conditions as well as the statutory provisions, and if the goods are defective, the Buyer has statutory rights according to the following conditions:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">a)	At first IMCD is entitled to choose whether it cures or repairs the defect or supply the Buyer with a replacement of the good purchased in condition free of defect.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">b)	In case two attempts from IMCD’s side to repair/replace the good according to a) have failed or any such repair/replacement is unacceptable for the Customer, the Customer is entitled to either withdraw from contract or to claim a reduction of the purchase price. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">c)	Any claims for damages and for reimbursement of expenses for a fault/defect are restricted according to clause 8.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">The warranty or other liability for the quality of the products is excluded, if the defect to the non-compliance with operating and maintenance instructions of IMCD by the Buyer and/or normal wear and tear of the essential substance of the products and/or modifications or repairs without the written consent of IMCD is due. This warranty will lapse if the Buyer fails to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. Invoking the warranty will not release the Buyer from its obligations under the Agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions. In case of a breach of the warranty, the Buyer&#39;s only remedy is a claim for performance of the Agreement by IMCD. IMCD is liable for defects in accordance with the statutory provisions, whereby IMCD is entitled to the right to choose the type of subsequent performance.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">7.2.	Any claims for damages due to defects shall only exist in accordance with Article 8 of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Delivery.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">7.3.	Claims for defects shall become statute-barred within one year of delivery, unless Article 8.1 applies. In this case, the Buyer&#39;s claims shall become statute-barred within the statutory periods. Sec. 445a, 445b BGB remain unaffected.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 8	LIABILITY</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">8.1.	IMCD is liable according to the legal regulations in case of intent, gross negligence, culpable injury of life, body or health, in case of assumption of a guarantee or a procurement risk and in case of liability according to the product liability law.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">8.2.	IMCD is also liable in the case of a simple negligent violation of essential contractual obligations, i.e. such obligations whose fulfillment makes the proper execution of the contract possible in the first place and on whose compliance the Buyer regularly relies and may rely. In this case, however, the liability of IMCD is limited to the amount of the damage typical for the contract and foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">8.3.	Further liability is excluded.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">8.4.	The above regulations also apply if damage is caused by organs of IMCD, legal representatives, employees or other vicarious agents.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">As far as the liability of IMCD is excluded or limited according to the above regulations, this also applies to the personal liability of the organs, legal representatives, employees and other vicarious agents of IMCD.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 9	LEGAL CONFORMITY</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">9.1.	The Buyer shall comply with all applicable treaties and laws, including but not limited to laws against acceptance of gifts and bribery such as the 2010 Bribery Act of the United Kingdom, export control and customs regulations such as (i) regulations concerning embargoed countries, (ii) restrictions on the sale of Products to customers subject to restrictions or prohibitions and (iii) regulations governing the control of the export, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use goods. The Buyer will not pass on, sell, transport or otherwise transfer the products purchased by IMCD directly or indirectly to or via a country, legal entity or natural person for use against which a prohibition exists according to national or international regulations.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">9.2.	The Buyer shall comply with all obligations that may be imposed on it under REACH and shall promptly provide IMCD with all information that may be necessary for IMCD to comply with REACH. The Buyer shall reimburse IMCD for all costs and expenses incurred by IMCD in connection with the obligations under REACH due to the intended use of the products by the Buyer. All information and data provided by IMCD about the substances contained in the products are strictly confidential and may only be disclosed by the Buyer if required by REACH.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">9.3.	Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Article 9, the Buyer shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in fulfilling its obligations under the Contract in accordance with the IMCD Code of Conduct. The Buyer confirms that he has read and agrees to the IMCD Code of Conduct. The IMCD Code of Conduct is available at the following website: www.IMCDgroup.com.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">9.4.	The Buyer shall ensure that the obligations under this Article 9 are transferred to third parties to whom IMCD products are supplied, whether in their original form or as an intermediate or end product, and that all third parties in the supply chain up to the end user are subject to the same legal compliance obligations.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">9.5.	The Buyer undertakes to indemnify and hold IMCD, its officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against all claims, damages, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable costs of legal representation, arising out of any claims, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, judgments or settlements arising out of the Buyer&#39;s failure to comply with the provisions of this Article 9.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 10	FORCE MAJEURE (FAILURE TO FULFIL THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACT FOR REASONS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PARTIES)</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">10.1.	IMCD shall not be liable for impossibility or delay insofar as these are based on force majeure or other events which were not foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract and for which IMCD is not responsible (e.g. operational disturbances of all kinds, fire, natural catastrophes, weather, floods, war, insurrection, terrorism, transport delays, strikes, lawful lockouts, shortage of labour, energy or raw materials, delays in the granting of any necessary official approvals, official/ sovereign measures and late or defective delivery by IMCD’s suppliers).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">10.2.	If it becomes foreseeable for IMCD that a delivery deadline cannot be met, IMCD shall immediately notify the Buyer thereof and inform him of the expected new delivery deadline.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">10.3.	In case of force majeure, the delivery periods are automatically extended by the duration of the event plus a reasonable restart time. Furthermore, IMCD is entitled to withdraw from the contract if such events make the performance of IMCD considerably more difficult or impossible and are not only of temporary duration. If the Buyer can no longer reasonably be expected to accept the performance due to the delay that occurs as a result of such an event, he can also withdraw from the contract by immediate written declaration; unreasonableness can only be assumed if the anticipated new delivery period is later than 30 calendar days after the originally planned delivery date or is not foreseeable.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 11	CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">11.1.	Unless otherwise agreed in writing, payment shall be made within 14 days of the invoice date without deductions and/or counterclaims in the currency stated in the invoice.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">11.2.	If payment is not made in full within the specified period, the Buyer shall be deemed by law to be in default of payment and shall pay statutory default interest on the outstanding amount at the current rate of 9 % p.a. from the date of commencement of the default until full payment of the invoice.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">11.3.	The Buyer shall reimburse IMCD for the actual judicial and extrajudicial costs, including attorneys&#39; fees, incurred as a result of the Buyer&#39;s failure to perform the contractual obligations in full or to perform the contractual obligations on time. The legal default lump sum (§ 288 Abs. 5 BGB) is added.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">11.4.	Complaints regarding invoicing are only admissible within the payment period. Complaints must be made in writing. Complaints do not lead to a suspension of the payment obligation of the Buyer.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">11.5.	Irrespective of any instructions to the contrary given by the Buyer, payments made shall first be credited against court costs, out-of-court collection costs and accruing interest and then against outstanding capital amounts, beginning with the oldest debt.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 12	CALCULATION AND RETRODUCTION RIGHTS</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">12.1.	The Buyer shall only be entitled to offset and assert a right of retention if his counter-claim is undisputed or has been established as final and absolute.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">12.2.	IMCD shall be entitled to refuse its services outstanding within a contractual relationship if it becomes apparent after conclusion of the contract (e.g. by insolvency petition) that IMCD&#39;s claim for payment from the respective contractual relationship is endangered by the Buyer&#39;s inability to pay. IMCD&#39;s right to refuse performance does not apply if the payment is effected or security is provided for it. IMCD is entitled to determine a reasonable period of time for the Buyer within which he has to effect his payment or provide security for it step by step against the performance to IMCD according to his choice. IMCD can withdraw from the contract after unsuccessful expiry of the deadline. In the case of contracts for the manufacture of unjustifiable items (custom-made items), IMCD can declare its withdrawal immediately.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 13	EXTENDED RESERVATION OF TITLE</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">13.1.	The products delivered by IMCD to the Buyer (including the items replacing them in accordance with the following provisions and also covered by the retention of title) remain the property of IMCD (&quot;Reserved Goods&quot;) until complete payment of all claims arising from the business relationship.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">13.2.	The Buyer is not entitled to pledge the Reserved Goods or to assign them as security. In the event of seizure of the Reserved Goods by third parties or other access by third parties, the Buyer must clearly point out the ownership of IMCD and inform IMCD immediately in writing so that IMCD can pursue its ownership rights.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">13.3.	The Buyer is entitled to use, process, transform, combine, mix and/or sell the Reserved Goods in the ordinary course of business as long as no application has been made for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the Buyer&#39;s assets and as long as the Buyer is not unable to pay.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">13.4.	If the Reserved Goods are processed or transformed by the Buyer (§ 950 BGB), it applies that this is always done for IMCD as manufacturer in the name and for the account of IMCD. IMCD directly acquires the ownership of the newly created object or – if the processing or transformation is carried out from materials of several owners – the co-ownership (fractional ownership) of it in the ratio of the value of the Reserved Goods (gross invoice value) to the value of the other processed/transformed materials at the time of the processing/transforming.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">13.5.	The Buyer already now assigns to IMCD in its entirety – in case of co-ownership of IMCD&#39;s Reserved Goods pro rata according to co-ownership share of IMCD – the Buyer&#39;s re-muneration claims against his customers from a resale of the Reserved Goods as well as those claims of the Buyer with regard to the Reserved Goods which arise from any other legal reason against his customers or third parties (in particular claims from tort and claims to insurance benefits), including all balance claims from current account. IMCD hereby accepts this assignment.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">13.6.	IMCD hereby revocably authorizes the Buyer to collect the claims assigned to IMCD in his own name for IMCD. The right of IMCD to collect these claims itself is not affected by this. However, IMCD will not collect them itself and will not revoke the collection authorisation as long as the Buyer duly fulfils his payment obligations towards IMCD (in particular does not fall into arrears), as long as no application for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the assets of the Buyer and as long as there is no lack of ability to pay on the part of the Buyer. If one of the aforementioned cases occurs, IMCD can demand from the Buyer that he discloses the claims assigned to IMCD and the respective debtors, informs the respective debtors of the assignment and hands over to IMCD all documents and transmits all information that IMCD requires to assert the claims.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">If IMCD withdraws from the contract due to behaviour of the Buyer contrary to the contract according to the legal regulations, IMCD is entitled to demand the Reserved Goods from the Buyer. IMCD&#39;s declaration of withdrawal is also available at the latest with IMCD&#39;s demand for return. The transport costs incurred for the return shall be borne by the Buyer.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 14	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">14.1.	The Contract and these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Delivery shall not result in the transfer or grant to the Buyer of any license to any intellectual property rights.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">14.2.	The Buyer warrants to IMCD at all times that the use of data, specifications or material provided by the Buyer to IMCD will not violate any statutory provisions or infringe the rights of third parties and shall indemnify and hold IMCD harmless in this respect.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 15	SEVERABILITY CLAUSE</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">If any provision of the Contract or these General Conditions of Sale and Delivery is or becomes illegal, invalid, non-binding or unenforceable (in whole or in part) under any provision of any law,</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">a)	to the extent that this provision is unlawful, invalid, non-binding or unenforceable, it shall not form part of this Agreement, but shall not affect the legality, validity, enforceability and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement or these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Delivery;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">b)	IMCD and the Buyer undertake to agree on a provision which is legally compliant, valid, binding and enforceable and which is as similar as possible in content and purpose to the original provision.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Article 16	APPLICABLE LAW AND COURT OF JUSTICE</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">All contracts and these General Conditions of Sale and Delivery, including this Article 16, and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the contract or these General Conditions of Sale and Delivery shall be governed exclusively by German law. The application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and German International Private Law is expressly excluded. All disputes in connection with this agreement shall be governed by the arbitration rules of the &quot;Deutsche Institution für Schiedsgerichtsbarkeit e. V.&quot; (DIS) shall be finally settled under exclusion of the ordinary legal process. The following shall apply in this respect:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">a)	The place of arbitration shall be Cologne.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">b)	The arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with applicable law.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">c)	The number of arbitrators shall be three.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">d)	The language of the arbitration proceedings shall be German.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">e)	The applicable substantive law shall be German law.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">f)	The arbitral tribunal may not publish the arbitral judgment.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">IMCD may also submit disputes within the meaning of this Article 16 to the competent court in Cologne, Germany, for decision.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">IMCD is also entitled to such a right of choice if the Buyer intends to sue IMCD. In this case, the Buyer can request IMCD to exercise the right of choice. The right of choice expires if IMCD does not exercise its right of choice towards the Buyer within 14 days after the request. </span></p><p><br></p>",All,false,1,Approved,DE SL,,a0t5E000002gGwGQAU

Le paiement ne pourra etre considéré effectué que lors de l’encaissement effectif du prix par IMCD.</p><p>En cas de non paiement d’une échéance ou d’une seule fraction du prix, la vente pourra etre résolue de plein droit, si bon semble a IMCD, huit (8) jours apres la notification d’une mise en demeure restée infructueuse et sans autre formalité. IMCD se réserve en outre le droit de procéder a la restitution des Produits sans recourir a une quelconque formalité préalable.</p><p>Tous acomptes antérieurement payés resteront acquis a IMCD a titre de clause pénale. L’Acheteur sera tenu pour seul responsable de tous les risques de détérioration, de perte, de destruction partielle ou totale, sous réserve que la cause du dommage ne résulte pas d’un cas de force majeure.</p><p>L’Acheteur devra en conséquence assurer les dits Produits, sous réserve de propriété, stipuler dans la police d’assurance que toute indemnité sera payée directement a IMCD et fournir a cette derniere, a sa premiere demande, toute justification de l&#39;assurance ainsi souscrite. Jusqu’au complet paiement, l’Acheteur s’interdit de conférer un nantissement ou gage sur les Produits vendus, sous réserve de propriété, ou de les utiliser a titre de garantie. L’Acheteur s’oblige a informer tout tiers, notamment en cas de saisie, du fait que les Produits sous clause de réserve de propriété appartiennent a IMCD et a informer IMCD immédiatement de toute saisie ou opération similaire. Nonobstant la présente clause de réserve de propriété, tous les risques afférents aux Produits vendus sont a la charge de l’Acheteur, des remise des Produits au transporteur ou a l’Acheteur directement.</p><p>11. GARANTIE – RESPONSABILITE</p><p>IMCD exclut toute garantie des vices cachés telle que définie par les articles 549 et suivants du Dahir portant Code des Obligations et des Contrats.</p><p>En sa qualité de vendeur, IMCD n’est tenue d’aucune autre obligation que celle de délivrer les Produits commandés. L’Acheteur est seul responsable du choix et des conditions d’emploi des Produits qu’il a commandés aupres d’IMCD. Il appartient a l’Acheteur de s’assurer avant de passer commande que les produits d’IMCD conviennent a l’utilisation envisagée par lui. IMCD ne garantit aucune performance particuliere d’un Produit, ni aucune utilisation particuliere d’un Produit qui n’aurait été préalablement portée a sa connaissance par écrit et acceptée expressément par IMCD.</p><p>IMCD ne pourra, notamment, en aucun cas etre responsable des dommages de toutes sortes causés par l’utilisation, le mélange, la manipulation ou l’incorporation a une formulation, par le stockage ou le transport des Produits vendus, et IMCD ne pourra en aucun cas etre tenu de réparer les dits dommages.</p><p>Quelque soit le fondement de son obligation a réparation, IMCD ne sera tenue a la réparation d’aucun dommage immatériel, direct ou indirect, couts et pertes de quelque sorte que ce soit consécutifs a l’achat ou a l’utilisation des Produits. L’Acheteur devra prendre toute assurance nécessaire, avec renonciation a recours, pour de tels dommages, couts et pertes.</p><p>Les frais de transport des Produits retournés suite a l’accord préalable et écrit d’IMCD seront a la charge de l’Acheteur.</p><p>4</p><p>S’agissant de tout dommage matériel dont la cause ne serait pas du fait de l’Acheteur, l’obligation a réparation d’IMCD est limitée, au choix d’IMCD, soit au remplacement des Produits, soit a l’établissement d’un avoir dont le montant est limité aux prix facturé des Produits, sans donner droit au versement d’une quelconque autre indemnité pour quelque cause que ce soit.</p><p>14. DROIT APPLICABLE – ATTRIBUTION DE JURIDICTION</p><p>L’ensemble de la relation contractuelle entre IMCD et l’Acheteur issue de l’application des présentes CGV, et les éventuels accords particuliers qui pourraient etre conclus, et tous les litiges en découlant, quelle qu’en soit la nature, seront soumis au droit marocain.</p><p>IMCD et l’Acheteur conviennent de faire leur possible pour résoudre a l’amiable les désaccords susceptibles de résulter de l’interprétation, l’exécution ou la cessation de leur relation commerciale.</p><p>Tout litige ayant son origine dans l’exécution des relations contractuelles établies entre IMCD et l’Acheteur, ainsi que les actes qui en seront la conséquence, sera soumis a la compétence exclusive des Tribunaux de Commerce de Casablanca, nonobstant toute demande incidente ou tout appel en garantie ou en cas de pluralité de défendeurs. Cette clause d’attribution de compétence s’appliquera meme en cas de référé.</p><p>IMCD disposera néanmoins de la faculté de saisir toute autre juridiction compétente, en particulier celle du siege social de l’Acheteur ou celle du lieu de situation des Produits livrés.</p><p>5</p>",All,false,1,Approved,MR SL,,a0t5E000002gGwIQAU

GÉNÉRALITÉS 1.1 Définitions :</p><p>Contrat : tout contrat et/ou acte juridique entre IMCD et l’Acheteur relatif a</p><p>l’acquisition de produits que fera l’Acheteur aupres d’IMCD.

REACH : Reglement (CE) no 1907/2006 du Parlement Européen et du Conseil du 18 décembre 2006 concernant l’enregistrement, l’évaluation et l’autorisation des substances chimiques, ainsi que les restrictions applicables a ces substances, et ses derniers amendements. Termes et Conditions : les présents termes et conditions de vente d’IMCD. 1.2 Sauf autre convention expresse par écrit, les présents Termes et Conditions seront applicables a toutes les offres et a tous les devis d’IMCD, au Contrat et a tous les actes juridiques et a toutes les actions en justice entre IMCD et l’Acheteur. 1.3 Tout écart par rapport aux présents Termes et Conditions n’est valide que s’il est</p><p>expressément convenu par écrit. 1.4 Est expressément écartée l’applicabilité des termes et conditions générales utilisés par</p><p>l’Acheteur, ou d’autres termes et conditions générales. 1.5 Le texte en castillan des présents Termes et Conditions sera toujours le texte définitif et</p><p>prévaudra sur toutes les traductions en cas de conflit. 1.6 Le texte du Contrat prévaudra sur les présents Termes et Conditions en cas de conflit.</p><p>Clause Deux. OFFRES ET ACCORDS 2.1 Toutes les offres, les devis et les propositions de prix d’IMCD seront soumises a tout moment au contrat et pourront etre modifiés ou révoqués a tout moment, indépendamment du fait qu’ils comportent ou non une période d’acceptation. 2.2 Les ajouts, les promesses ou les changements faits oralement ne seront contraignants que</p><p>s’ils ont été faits par des personnes autorisées d’IMCD. 2.3 Les échantillons et modeles montrés ou fournis le seront simplement a titre indicatif, sans qu’il soit nécessaire que les produits soient exactement conformes auxdits échantillons ou auxdits modeles. Ne seront pas considérés comme des défauts les petites variations de taille, de poids, de nombre, de couleur et aspects similaires définis. La pratique commerciale décidera s’il s’agit de variations mineures. 2.4 IMCD sera autorisée a tout moment, avant de commencer ou de continuer son exécution, a exiger de la part de l’Acheteur une garantie pour l’exécution de ses obligations dérivées du présent Contrat. La garantie sera fournie de la façon dont IMCD le précisera. 2.5 Si au bout de 14 jours a compter de la demande pour ce faire, l’Acheteur n’a pas fourni de garantie de la façon précisée par IMCD, tous les montants dus par l’Acheteur a IMCD seront portés au débit et seront payables intégralement et immédiatement, sans que préalablement une notification d’inexécution soit nécessaire.</p><p>Clause Trois. LIVRAISONS 3.1 Sauf autre convention expresse par écrit, la livraison sera Départ usine (Incoterms EXW). 3.2 La livraison aura lieu conformément aux définitions de la derniere version des Incoterms.

Le moment de la livraison est celui ou les produits acquis arrivent sur le lieu de livraison, meme si l’Acheteur n’accepte pas cette derniere. Pour des livraisons Départ usine, le moment de la livraison est celui ou IMCD notifie a l’Acheteur que les produits acquis sont prets a etre récupérés. 3.4 Sauf autre convention expresse par écrit, la période de livraison spécifiée et convenue ne sera pas un délai définitif. Le simple fait qu’IMCD dépasse la période de livraison convenue no constituera pas une inexécution du contrat, cela ne sera ni une défaillance ni une responsabilité a assumer vis-a-vis de l’Acheteur et cela n’autorisera pas ce dernier a résilier le Contrat. 3.5 S’il n’a pas été expressément convenu d’une période de livraison, une période raisonnable</p><p>pour ce faire sera appliquée. 3.6 A tout moment, IMCD aura le droit de livrer la marchandise en lots, et elle sera toujours</p><p>autorisée a facturer lesdites prestations séparément. 3.7 Si l’Acheteur n’accepte pas la livraison ou, dans le cas de livraisons Départ usine, s’il ne récupere pas les produits livrés dans les sept jours suivant la livraison et/ou de la façon précisée par IMCD, l’Acheteur sera défaillant sans que cela requiert une notification a ce sujet, et IMCD sera autorisée dans tous les cas a facturer le prix convenu. Par ailleurs, IMCD sera habilitée, sans préjudice des autres droits prévus par la Loi, a stocker les produits pour le compte et aux risques et périls de l’Acheteur ; tous les couts dérivés, y compris les hausses de tarifs, taxes, primes et couts similaires, seront a la charge de l’Acheteur. 3.8 Si une situation prévue dans la Clause 3.7 se présente, bien qu’IMCD ait accordé une période de temps raisonnable, et que l’Acheteur n’a toujours pas récupéré les produits ou qu’il ne le fait pas au moment adéquat et/ou de la façon opportune, IMCD sera exonérée de toutes ses obligations. Dans ce cas, IMCD pourra compenser le remboursement du prix d’achat (s’il a été payé) avec les couts de stockage encourus et avec la perte de valeur que les produits auront subie depuis la livraison.</p><p>Clause Quatre. PRIX 4.1 Sauf autre convention expresse par écrit, tous les prix seront Départ usine. Les prix n’incluront pas la TVA, les frais de transport et/ou d’envoi des produits, ni les autres frais impliqués par la livraison, les taxes gouvernementales ni les charges applicables. Toutes les commandes incluront une taxe Sécurité et Environnement (SMA) de 20,09.- €. Par ailleurs, aux commandes d’un montant inférieur a 1 500.- € (TVA non incluse) s’ajoutera une charge pour bon de commande minimum (CAM) de 54,20.- €. (TVA non incluse) 4.2 A tout moment, IMCD sera autorisée a modifier ses prix, a condition que les prix déja convenus puissent etre modifiés uniquement si les facteurs de détermination des couts sur lesquels sont basés les prix ont changé depuis que le Contrat a été signé et avant la livraison. Lesdits ajustements n’autoriseront pas l’Acheteur a résilier le Contrat. Les facteurs de détermination des couts mentionnés comprendront, mais de façon non exclusive, les prix des matieres premieres, couts de main d’ouvre, dépenses</p><p>TERMES ET CONDITIONS GÉNÉRALES DE VENTE DE IMCD ESPANA ESPECIALIDADES QUIMICAS, S.A.</p><p>Version 02 (2017-03)</p><p>General terms and conditions of sale IMCD Spain</p><p>de sécurité sociale, taxes (y compris la TVA et les autres taxes gouvernementales), droits a l’importation et a l’exportation, ainsi que les taux de change. Clause Cinq. ÉQUIPEMENT POUR TRANSPORT ET EMBALLAGE 5.1 Conformément a l’Article 18 du Reglement de la Loi 11/1997 sur les Emballages et Déchets d’Emballages, la responsabilité d’une gestion environnementale correcte des emballages industriels incombe au détenteur final. 5.2 Le chargement ou le remplissage de l’équipement pour le transport et/ou de l’emballage mis a disposition par l’Acheteur se fera pour le compte et aux risques et périls de l’Acheteur. Nonobstant, en cas de responsabilité d’IMCD, les dispositions de la Clause 8 des présents Termes et Conditions seront intégralement applicables. 5.3 IMCD sera autorisée a refuser le chargement de l’équipement et/ou le remplissage de l’emballage s’il ne répond pas aux exigences raisonnables de sécurité fixées par IMCD. Dans ce cas, IMCD n’assumera pas la charge des couts dérivés d’une éventuelle défaillance. Dans les couts étant inclus les couts mentionnés dans la Clause 3.7.</p><p>Clause Six. RETOURS, RÉCLAMATIONS ET GARANTIE 6.1. Sans son consentement préalable par écrit, IMCD ne sera pas obligée d’accepter des retours de l’Acheteur. Si les produits sont retournés sans le consentement préalable par écrit d’IMCD, l’envoi et le stockage de ces derniers postérieurs au retour seront a la charge et se feront aux risques et périls de l’Acheteur. 6.2. L’Acheteur continuera a assumer le risque des produits retournés jusqu’a ce qu’IMCD ait accepté le retour et les produits retournés par écrit, acceptation a laquelle IMCD pourra joindre des conditions. 6.3. L’Acheteur se chargera de vérifier par lui-meme ou de faire vérifier la conformité des produits durant leur livraison. Les réclamations doivent etre faites par écrit dans les 14 jours suivant la date de livraison, en indiquant les motifs de la réclamation et, si possible, en y joignant des preuves ; en cas d’inexécution de l’Acheteur, on considérera que ce dernier a accepté la quantité et la qualité des produits, et il perdra son droit de réclamation aupres d’IMCD en ce qui concerne les défauts dans les produits fournis, conformément aux dispositions de la Clause 7 relative aux garanties. 6.4. Ne seront pas acceptées les réclamations concernant des produits qui auront déja été traités</p><p>et/ou travaillés d’une quelconque façon apres la livraison. 6.5. La présentation d’une réclamation n’exemptera pas l’Acheteur de ses obligations de</p><p>paiement. 6.6. Si une réclamation est présentée a temps et conformément aux présents Termes et Conditions, et qu’IMCD croit raisonnablement que la réclamation est justifiée, IMCD pourra choisir de verser le montant correspondant, ou de procéder a une nouvelle livraison gratuite des produits dont il aura été démontré qu’ils étaient défectueux, ou de concéder une remise sur le prix. En agissant de l’une des façons mentionnées, IMCD aura totalement exécuté son obligation de garantie et ne sera pas obligée de payer d’autre indemnisation. Les produits remplacés deviendront la propriété d’IMCD. 6.7. La garantie des produits livrés par des tiers ne pourra pas etre augmentée au-dela de la</p><p>période de garantie que le fabricant ou l’importateur desdits produits fixera pour IMCD. 6.8. Toute réclamation conformément a la Clause 6 sera caduque dans tous les cas trois mois</p><p>apres la date de livraison.</p><p>Clause Sept. GARANTIE</p><p>IMCD garantit, qu’au moment de la livraison, les produits vendus a l’Acheteur seront conformes aux spécifications qu’IMCD aura définies pour l’Acheteur en ce qui concerne lesdits produits. IMCD ne réalisera aucune garantie expresse ou implicite concernant le caractere commercialisable ou l’adéquation a une fin concrete des produits. Ladite garantie sera caduque si l’Acheteur n’exécute pas ses obligations dérivées de ce Contrat et/ou des présents Termes et Conditions. Invoquer la garantie n’exemptera pas l’Acheteur de ses obligations dérivées de ce Contrat ni des présents Termes et Conditions. En cas d’inexécution de la garantie, l’unique recours de l’Acheteur sera une réclamation relative a l’exécution du Contrat par IMCD.</p><p>Clause Huit. RESPONSABILITÉ 8.1. IMCD n’assumera pas la responsabilité des dommages que subira l’Acheteur, indépendamment du fait que le dommage soit du a une inexécution d’IMCD de ses obligations dérivées de ce Contrat et/ou des présents Termes et Conditions (y compris l’obligation de garantie de la Clause 7), ou a un acte et/ou une omission d’IMCD et/ou de tiers qui agiront selon les instructions d’IMCD, sauf si l’Acheteur prouve que le dommage est exclusivement du a une imprudence intentionnelle ou malveillante du fait de la gestion d’IMCD. 8.2. IMCD n’assumera pas la responsabilité des pertes indirectes de toute nature, y compris des pertes en résultant et des pertes de bénéfices, et des pertes morales que subira l’Acheteur ou un tiers du fait d’une inexécution du Contrat par IMCD, ou une personne dont cette derniere sera légalement responsable. 8.3. IMCD n’assume pas la responsabilité des dommages, de toute nature et de quelque façon</p><p>qu’ils surviennent, apres que les produits livrés par IMCD auront été traités et/ou travaillés. 8.4. IMCD ne garantit pas l’intégrité et l’exactitude des informations que recevra IMCD de son propre fournisseur et n’assumera pas la responsabilité des dommages - de toute nature et de quelque façon – subis du fait du caractere incomplet ou de l’imprécision de ces informations. 8.5. Dans tous les cas, la responsabilité d’IMCD sera toujours limitée dans chaque cas, en considérant une série de faits liés comme un seul fait, au montant payé conformément a la police d’assurance de responsabilité commerciale d’IMCD dans le cas en question. 8.6. L’Acheteur doit indemniser IMCD, et l’exonérer de toute responsabilité face a des réclamations de tiers, pour tout motif, en rapport avec l’indemnisation pour dommages, couts et/ou pertes qui surviendraient concernant les produits livrés par IMCD a l’Acheteur, sauf et dans la mesure ou l’Acheteur démontre que la réclamation releve exclusivement de la sphere de responsabilité d’IMCD. 8.7. Les dispositions figurant dans la présente Clause seront applicables aux personnes morales</p><p>et physiques qu’emploiera IMCD pour l’exécution du Contrat. 8.8. Les réclamations pour dommages, dans tous les cas, seront caduques au bout des trois</p><p>mois suivant la date de livraison.</p><p>Clause Neuf. RESPECT DE LA LOI 9.1 L’Acheteur se conformera a la législation applicable, comprenant, mais de façon non exclusive, les lois contre la subornation et la corruption, comme la Loi sur la lutte contre la subornation de 2010 du Royaume-Uni, et les lois relatives au contrôle des exportations et a la réglementation douaniere, comme, par exemple : (i) les regles en matiere de pays soumis a l’embargo, (ii) les limitations de vente de produits a des clients restreints ou rejetés, et (iii) le régime de contrôle des exportations, transfert, courtage et trafic de produits a double usage.

Toutes les informations et les données fournies par IMCD au sujet des substances contenues dans les produits sont strictement confidentielles et pourront uniquement etre révélées par l’Acheteur lorsque cela sera exigé par REACH. 9.3 Sans préjudice des autres dispositions de la Clause 9, l’Acheteur se conformera aux lois et aux reglements applicables en exécutant ses obligations dérivées de ce Contrat de façon cohérente avec le Code de Conduite d’IMCD.

FORCE MAJEURE (INEXÉCUTION NON IMPUTABLE) 10.1 Si, en cas de force majeure, IMCD se voit empechée d’exécuter le Contrat, ou si son exécution est plus onéreuse, IMCD a le droit de suspendre le Contrat totalement ou en partie pendant le temps que durera la situation de force majeure, ou de résilier le Contrat totalement ou en partie, sans intervention judiciaire et sans qu’IMCD soit obligée de payer une indemnisation. 10.2 Le terme « force majeure » signifie ici toute circonstance, prévue ou imprévue, qui empecherait IMCD, de façon permanente ou temporaire, d’exécuter le Contrat. Dans tous les cas, il doit etre entendu que dans lesdites circonstances est incluse l’incapacité de faire face aux paiements pour quelque raison que ce soit, greve, maladie démesurée du personnel, interruption dans la production, problemes de transport, incendie ou autres altérations commerciales, interdictions d’importation, exportation et transport, livraison en retard ou défectueuse par les fournisseurs d’IMCD, et autres causes étrangeres au contrôle d’IMCD, comme inondation, tempete, catastrophe naturelle et/ou nucléaire, guerre et/ou menace de guerre, aussi bien que changements dans la législation et/ou les mesures gouvernementales.

Si le taux d’intéret de retard fixé dans la Loi 3/2004 est supérieur a 10%, l’Acheteur sera obligé de payer le taux d’intéret de retard conformément aux dispositions de la Loi 3/2004. 11.3. L’Acheteur paiera intégralement a IMCD ses frais judiciaires et extra-judiciaires réels, y compris les honoraires des avocats, a financer du fait de l’inexécution de l’Acheteur de ses obligations dérivées du Contrat dans leur totalité et/ou en temps utile, alors que, dans tous les cas, pour ladite inexécution, l’Acheteur sera obligé de payer a IMCD au moins les frais extra-judiciaires qui s’éleveront a 15 % du montant en suspens, avec un minimum de 125 €. 11.4. Sans préjudice des dispositions de la Clause 6.3, les réclamations relatives a la facturation pourront uniquement etre effectuées dans les limites du délai de paiement. Les réclamations doivent etre faites par écrit et leur présentation ne suspendra pas l’obligation de paiement de l’Acheteur. 11.5.

L’Acheteur ne pourra pas compenser les sommes dues a IMCD avec des réclamations de</p><p>l’Acheteur présentées a IMCD.</p><p>Clause Douze. SUSPENSION ET RÉSILIATION 12.1 Sans préjudice des dispositions de la Clause 10, et sans préjudice du droit a réclamer une indemnisation, IMCD pourra suspendre l’exécution de ses obligations dérivées du Contrat totalement ou en partie, ou résilier le Contrat totalement ou en partie de façon extra-judiciaire par notification écrite, sans obligation de payer une indemnisation, dans le cas ou (l’on s’attendrait raisonnablement a) : a) l’Acheteur n’exécuterait pas substantiellement l’une de ses obligations dérivées du Contrat, comme, par exemple, son obligation de payer a temps et intégralement ; b) serait réalisé un embargo contre l’Acheteur ; c) serait concédé un moratoire a l’Acheteur ; d) se présenterait une demande pour faillite de l’Acheteur, ou l’Acheteur serait déclaré en faillite ; e) l’Acheteur passerait un accord de paiement avec un ou plusieurs créanciers ; f) l’Acheteur décéderait, serait placé sous tutelle ou serait soumis a l’administration judiciaire ; ou g) serait vendue ou dissoute l’entreprise de l’Acheteur. 12.2 Si, conformément a la Clause 12.1, IMCD suspend l’exécution du Contrat, l’Acheteur, a la demande d’IMCD, augmentera les lettres de crédit prescrites par Contrat et/ou la garantie requise conformément a la Clause 2.4 des présents Termes et Conditions jusqu’a la nouvelle date de livraison. 12.3 Si, conformément a la Clause 12.1, IMCD résilie le Contrat totalement ou en partie, IMCD</p><p>General terms and conditions of sale IMCD Spain</p><p>pourra réclamer, comme étant sa propriété, les produits livrés, mais qui n’auront pas encore été payés intégralement, compensés avec des sommes déja versées, sans préjudice de son droit a indemnisation. 12.4 Si l’une des situations décrites dans la Clause 12.1 se présente, tous les montants dus par l’Acheteur a IMCD seront portés au débit et payés intégralement et immédiatement, sans que soit nécessaire une notification préalable de retard. 12.5 L’Acheteur ne pourra suspendre, sous aucun motif, l’exécution de ses obligations dérivées de ou en rapport avec le Contrat ou les présents Termes et Conditions.</p><p>Clause Treize. RÉSERVE DE PROPRIÉTÉ 13.1 Les produits que fournit IMCD a l’Acheteur resteront la propriété d’IMCD aussi longtemps que l’Acheteur n’aura pas payé toutes les sommes, y compris les intérets et frais, qu’il devra a IMCD conformément ou concernant le Contrat. 13.2 Avant que le paiement n’ait été effectué complétement, l’Acheteur n’aura pas le droit de donner en gage totalement ou en partie les produits a des tiers. L’Acheteur n’aura pas le droit de transmettre la titularité des produits, sauf conformément a ses activités habituelles ou a l’usage normal des produits. 13.3 L’Acheteur entretiendra les produits livrés avec soumission a la réserve de propriété avec la due diligence et comme propriété reconnaissable d’IMCD, et assurera lesdits produits contre les dommages et le vol. 13.4 Si l’une des situations décrites dans la Clause 12.1 se présente, IMCD aura le droit de retirer par elle-meme, ou de faire retirer par quelqu’un, a la charge de l’Acheteur, les produits qui seront de sa propriété du lieu ou ces derniers seront situés.

OFFRES ET ACCORDS 2.1 Toutes les offres, les devis et les propositions de prix d’IMCD seront soumises a tout moment au contrat et pourront etre modifiés ou révoqués a tout moment, indépendamment du fait qu’ils comportent ou non une période d’acceptation. 2.2 Les ajouts, les promesses ou les changements faits oralement ne seront contraignants que</p><p>s’ils ont été faits par des personnes autorisées d’IMCD. 2.3 Les échantillons et modeles montrés ou fournis le seront simplement a titre indicatif, sans qu’il soit nécessaire que les produits soient exactement conformes auxdits échantillons ou auxdits modeles.

Seller shall have no liability, for any latent defect where the subject Product has been improperly handled or stored, or otherwise abused, after delivery to Buyer unless Buyer can show that such improper handling or storage or other abuse would not have affected the Product or otherwise impaired the usefulness thereof. Failure of Seller to receive written notice of any such claim within the applicable time period shall be deemed an absolute and unconditional waiver by Buyer of such claim. </p><p>(c) Disputes concerning failure to meet specifications: In case of a dispute as to whether Product meets contract specifications, Seller and Buyer shall designate a mutually acceptable independent testing company and/or surveyor to make an examination and in such case said testing company’s

therefor and Buyer’s obligation to accept and make payment on time for the balance of the Product delivered or to be delivered under the contract shall not be affected thereby.</p><p>13. FORCE

party. </p><p> </p><p>14. QUANTITY. Unless otherwise specified, Seller shall have the right to make partial shipments. Each partial shipment shall be deemed a separate sale, and payment shall become due therefor in accordance with the terms of payment contained in this Agreement. When in the opinion of Seller there is a period of shortage of supply of said products for any reason, including in the case of any Force Majeure Event, Seller may allocate its available supply among any or all of its various customers upon such basis as it shall deem fair and practicable, with no liability on its

efforts to assure that all third parties to whom Product is sold by Buyer, whether in original form or as intermediate or endproduct, will comply with the terms set out in the first paragraph of this section and agrees to refuse to supply Product to any such entity with respect to which Buyer has reasonable doubts that such compliance will be forthcoming. </p><p>The Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, from and against all claims, proceedings, investigations, damages, losses, liabilities, penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees arising from any claim, investigation, suit, action, proceeding, demand, judgment or settlement based in whole or in part on any actual or alleged failure

By performing in one of the stated ways, IMCD shall have discharged its guarantee obligation fully and shall not be obliged to pay any further compensation. </p><p>Replaced goods shall become the property of IMCD. </p><p>14.11 The guarantee on goods delivered by third parties may never extend beyond the guarantee that is provided to IMCD by the manufacturer or importer of those goods. </p><p>14.12 Any claim under this Article shall in any case lapse once three months have passed since receipt of the goods supplied.</p><p><br></p><p>15.
